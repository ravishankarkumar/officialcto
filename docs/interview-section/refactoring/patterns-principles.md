# Refactoring with Patterns and Principles

## Overview
Welcome to the fourth lecture of **Section 10: Mastering Refactoring** in the *Official CTO* journey! Refactoring with **patterns** and **principles** like SOLID, Strategy pattern, and Replace Nested Conditional with Guard Clauses enhances code maintainability and scalability. In this 25-minute lesson, we explore these techniques to address code smells like Large Class and complex conditionals, using a Java-based example of a payment processing system. Drawing from my 8+ years of mentoring engineers, this lecture equips you for FAANG interviews and real-world projects. Let’s continue your *Official CTO* journey!

Inspired by *Refactoring* by Martin Fowler, *Code Complete 2* (Chapter 24), and Refactoring.Guru, this lesson provides actionable insights and a practical example.

## Learning Objectives
- Master **refactoring techniques**: SOLID (SRP for Large Class), Strategy pattern, Replace Nested Conditional with Guard Clauses.
- Learn to **improve code maintainability** and address code smells.
- Prepare for **FAANG interviews** with pattern-focused refactoring questions.
- Apply refactoring in a **payment processing system** example.

## Why Refactoring with Patterns and Principles Matters
Using patterns and principles ensures code is maintainable, scalable, and aligned with FAANG standards. Drawing from my experience mentoring engineers, I’ve seen these techniques distinguish candidates in code reviews and leadership roles. This lecture ensures you can apply patterns, articulate their benefits, and align with industry standards.

In software engineering, refactoring with patterns and principles helps you:
- **Ace Interviews**: Demonstrate robust refactoring in coding exercises.
- **Reduce Technical Debt**: Simplify maintenance and prevent rewrites.
- **Enhance Scalability**: Build extensible systems.
- **Improve Collaboration**: Create clear, maintainable code.

## Key Concepts
### 1. SOLID Principles (Single Responsibility Principle)
- **Definition**: Each class should have one responsibility (*Refactoring* by Fowler).
- **Application**: Address Large Class smell by splitting responsibilities.
- **Example**: Separate payment processing from validation logic.

### 2. Strategy Pattern for Switch Statements
- **Definition**: Replace switch statements with polymorphic behavior (*Refactoring*).
- **Benefits**: Improves extensibility, reduces complexity.
- **Example**: Use Strategy to handle different payment methods.

### 3. Replace Nested Conditional with Guard Clauses
- **Definition**: Replace nested if-statements with early returns (*Refactoring*).
- **Benefits**: Simplifies logic, improves readability.
- **Example**: Use guard clauses for payment validation.

### 4. Role in FAANG Interviews
- Technical questions test pattern-based refactoring (e.g., “Refactor this switch statement using Strategy”).
- Behavioral questions assess experience (e.g., “Tell me about a time you applied SOLID principles”).
- Align with company priorities (e.g., Google’s clarity, Amazon’s ownership).

### 5. Relation to Previous Sections
- **Algorithms** (Section 1): Patterns clarify algorithmic logic.
- **OOD** (Section 2): Aligns with SOLID and pattern design.
- **Design Patterns** (Section 3): Directly applies Strategy pattern.
- **Design Principles** (Section 4): Builds on SOLID principles.
- **HLD/LLD** (Sections 5–6): Patterns support system design (e.g., Mock LLD Interview, Lecture 31).
- **Behavioral Skills** (Section 7): Articulating patterns builds on communication (Lecture 2).
- **Domain-Specific Topics** (Section 8): Patterns ensure maintainable cloud systems (e.g., microservices, Lecture 7).
- **Clean Code** (Section 9): Builds on readability, modularity, error handling, testability, documentation.
- **Refactoring Intro** (Section 10, Lecture 1): Builds on refactoring goals.
- **Code Smells** (Section 10, Lecture 2): Addresses Large Class and complex conditionals.
- **Simplifying Code** (Section 10, Lecture 3): Complements simplification techniques.

## Code Example: Refactoring a Payment Processing System
Below is a Java example showing a poorly written payment processing system with code smells, followed by its refactored version using patterns and principles.

### Before Refactoring
```java
public class PaymentProcessor {
    public String processPayment(String userId, String type, double amount, String cardDetails) {
        String result = "";
        if (userId != null && !userId.isEmpty()) {
            if (type.equals("credit")) {
                if (amount > 0 && cardDetails != null) {
                    if (cardDetails.length() == 16) {
                        result = "Processed credit payment of " + amount;
                    } else {
                        result = "Invalid card details";
                    }
                }
            } else if (type.equals("paypal")) {
                if (amount > 0 && cardDetails != null) {
                    if (cardDetails.contains("@")) {
                        result = "Processed PayPal payment of " + amount;
                    } else {
                        result = "Invalid PayPal email";
                    }
                }
            } else {
                result = "Invalid payment type";
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

### After Refactoring
```java
/**
 * Manages payment processing using different payment strategies.
 */
public class PaymentProcessor {
    private final PaymentStrategy paymentStrategy;

    /**
     * Constructs PaymentProcessor with a specific payment strategy.
     *
     * @param paymentStrategy Strategy for processing payments
     */
    public PaymentProcessor(PaymentStrategy paymentStrategy) {
        this.paymentStrategy = paymentStrategy;
    }

    /**
     * Processes a payment for a user based on request details.
     *
     * @param request Payment request with user ID, amount, and details
     * @return PaymentResult with processing details or error
     */
    public PaymentResult processPayment(PaymentRequest request) {
        if (request == null) {
            return new PaymentResult(false, "Invalid request");
        }
        if (request.getUserId() == null || request.getUserId().isEmpty()) {
            return new PaymentResult(false, "Invalid user ID");
        }
        if (request.getAmount() <= 0) {
            return new PaymentResult(false, "Invalid amount");
        }

        return paymentStrategy.process(request);
    }
}

/**
 * Represents a payment request.
 */
public class PaymentRequest {
    private final String userId;
    private final double amount;
    private final String paymentDetails;

    public PaymentRequest(String userId, double amount, String paymentDetails) {
        this.userId = userId;
        this.amount = amount;
        this.paymentDetails = paymentDetails;
    }

    public String getUserId() {
        return userId;
    }

    public double getAmount() {
        return amount;
    }

    public String getPaymentDetails() {
        return paymentDetails;
    }
}

/**
 * Represents the result of a payment operation.
 */
public class PaymentResult {
    private final boolean isSuccessful;
    private final String message;

    public PaymentResult(boolean isSuccessful, String message) {
        this.isSuccessful = isSuccessful;
        this.message = message;
    }

    public boolean isSuccessful() {
        return isSuccessful;
    }

    public String getMessage() {
        return message;
    }
}

interface PaymentStrategy {
    PaymentResult process(PaymentRequest request);
}

/**
 * Strategy for processing credit card payments.
 */
class CreditCardPaymentStrategy implements PaymentStrategy {
    private static final int CARD_LENGTH = 16;

    @Override
    public PaymentResult process(PaymentRequest request) {
        if (request.getPaymentDetails() == null || request.getPaymentDetails().length() != CARD_LENGTH) {
            return new PaymentResult(false, "Invalid card details");
        }
        return new PaymentResult(true, "Processed credit payment of " + request.getAmount());
    }
}

/**
 * Strategy for processing PayPal payments.
 */
class PayPalPaymentStrategy implements PaymentStrategy {
    @Override
    public PaymentResult process(PaymentRequest request) {
        if (request.getPaymentDetails() == null || !request.getPaymentDetails().contains("@")) {
            return new PaymentResult(false, "Invalid PayPal email");
        }
        return new PaymentResult(true, "Processed PayPal payment of " + request.getAmount());
    }
}
```

### Unit Tests
```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

class PaymentProcessorTest {
    private PaymentProcessor creditProcessor;
    private PaymentProcessor paypalProcessor;

    @BeforeEach
    void setUp() {
        creditProcessor = new PaymentProcessor(new CreditCardPaymentStrategy());
        paypalProcessor = new PaymentProcessor(new PayPalPaymentStrategy());
    }

    @Test
    void testCreditPayment_Success() {
        PaymentRequest request = new PaymentRequest("user123", 100.0, "1234567890123456");
        PaymentResult result = creditProcessor.processPayment(request);

        assertTrue(result.isSuccessful());
        assertEquals("Processed credit payment of 100.0", result.getMessage());
    }

    @Test
    void testPayPalPayment_Success() {
        PaymentRequest request = new PaymentRequest("user123", 50.0, "user@example.com");
        PaymentResult result = paypalProcessor.processPayment(request);

        assertTrue(result.isSuccessful());
        assertEquals("Processed PayPal payment of 50.0", result.getMessage());
    }

    @Test
    void testInvalidUserId() {
        PaymentRequest request = new PaymentRequest("", 100.0, "1234567890123456");
        PaymentResult result = creditProcessor.processPayment(request);

        assertFalse(result.isSuccessful());
        assertEquals("Invalid user ID", result.getMessage());
    }
}
```

- **Explanation**:
  - **Before Refactoring**: The original code has a Large Class smell (handling all payment logic), complex nested conditionals, and switch-like behavior.
  - **After Refactoring**:
    - **SOLID (SRP)**: Splits responsibilities into `CreditCardPaymentStrategy` and `PayPalPaymentStrategy`, addressing Large Class.
    - **Strategy Pattern**: Replaces switch-like logic with polymorphic strategies.
    - **Guard Clauses**: Uses early returns for input validation, simplifying conditionals.
  - **Test-Driven**: Unit tests ensure behavior preservation (*Refactoring* by Fowler).
  - **Improvements**: Enhances maintainability, extensibility, and readability.
- **Setup**:
  - Add dependency: `org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter`.
  - Run tests with `mvn test` or an IDE.
- **Big O**: O(1) for payment processing logic (excluding strategy-specific logic).
- **Edge Cases**: Handles null requests, invalid user IDs, and invalid payment details.
- **Trade-Offs**: Strategy pattern for extensibility vs. simpler switch statements; guard clauses for readability vs. nested conditionals.
