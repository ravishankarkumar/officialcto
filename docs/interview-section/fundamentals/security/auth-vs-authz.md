# Authentication vs Authorization

This article distinguishes between **authentication** and **authorization**, two fundamental concepts in security. Understanding their differences is essential for system design interviews and building secure applications.

## What is Authentication?
**Authentication** (often abbreviated as "authn") is the process of **verifying the identity** of a user, device, or system. It answers the question: **"Who are you?"**

### How Authentication Works
Authentication typically involves:
1. **Credentials Submission**: The user provides proof of identity, such as a username/password, token, or biometric data.
2. **Verification**: The system checks these credentials against stored data (e.g., a hashed password in a database).
3. **Session Creation**: Upon success, a session or token is issued to maintain the authenticated state.

### Common Authentication Methods
- **Username/Password**: Basic but vulnerable to breaches; use hashing (e.g., bcrypt) and salting.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Combines something you know (password), have (token/app), or are (biometrics).
- **OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect**: Delegated authentication for third-party apps (e.g., "Sign in with Google").
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Stateless tokens for API authentication.
- **Certificate-Based**: Uses digital certificates for machine-to-machine auth (e.g., TLS client certificates).

**Challenges**: Phishing, credential stuffing, and weak passwords. Best practices include rate limiting, CAPTCHA, and password policies.


## What is Authorization?
**Authorization** (often abbreviated as "authz") is the process of **determining what an authenticated user is allowed to do**. It answers the question: **"What can you do?"**

### How Authorization Works
Authorization occurs **after authentication** and involves:
1. **Policy Evaluation**: Checking user roles, permissions, or attributes against access control rules.
2. **Resource Access**: Granting or denying access to specific resources (e.g., files, APIs, databases).
3. **Enforcement**: The system blocks unauthorized actions, often logging them for auditing.

### Common Authorization Models
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Users are assigned roles (e.g., admin, user), and roles have permissions (e.g., read/write).
- **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**: Decisions based on attributes (e.g., user location, time of day, device type).
- **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**: Explicit lists of users/groups allowed/denied for a resource.
- **OAuth Scopes**: In API contexts, scopes define granular permissions (e.g., read:email, write:posts).

**Challenges**: Over-privileging (principle of least privilege), policy complexity, and dynamic changes in user roles.



## Key Differences: Authentication vs Authorization
| Aspect              | Authentication                          | Authorization                          |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**         | Verify identity ("Who are you?")        | Grant permissions ("What can you do?") |
| **Timing**          | First step in access flow               | After successful authentication        |
| **Outcome**         | User/session is validated               | Access to resources is allowed/denied  |
| **Examples**        | Logging in with password                | Admin can delete users; user can read  |
| **Failure**         | Access denied (401 Unauthorized)        | Access denied (403 Forbidden)          |
| **HTTP Status**     | 401 (Unauthenticated)                   | 403 (Unauthorized in some contexts)    |

**Note**: In HTTP, 401 is for unauthenticated (retry with credentials), while 403 is for authenticated but unauthorized.

### Analogy
Authentication is like showing your ID at a club entrance. Authorization is like the bouncer checking if your ID allows VIP access or just the dance floor.



## Real-World Integration
In modern systems:
- **AuthN + AuthZ Flow**: A user authenticates via OAuth, receives a token, and the token's claims (e.g., roles) are used for authorization.
- **Tools/Frameworks**: Use libraries like Spring Security (Java), Passport.js (Node.js), or Auth0 for handling both.
- **Zero Trust Model**: Assumes no implicit trust; re-authenticate and re-authorize continuously.

### Common Pitfalls
- Confusing the two: Implementing authz without proper authn exposes systems.
- Token Management: Secure storage (e.g., HttpOnly cookies for JWTs) and short expiration times.
- Scalability: Centralized auth (e.g., LDAP) vs. federated (e.g., SAML).



## Real-World Context
- **Interview Relevance**: System design questions often involve secure access patterns (e.g., "Design a microservices auth system"). Explain how authn feeds into authz.
- **Practical Use**: In cloud environments (AWS IAM, Azure AD), authn verifies identity, while policies enforce authz. Critical for compliance (GDPR, HIPAA).
- **Modern Trends**: Passwordless auth (e.g., WebAuthn), AI-driven anomaly detection, and blockchain for decentralized identity.
