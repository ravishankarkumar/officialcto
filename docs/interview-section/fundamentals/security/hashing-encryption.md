# Hashing vs Encryption

Hashing and encryption are two fundamental concepts in security that are often confused.  
Both transform data, but they serve **very different purposes**:  
- **Hashing** ensures *integrity* (data has not been tampered with).  
- **Encryption** ensures *confidentiality* (data is hidden from unauthorized users).  

Understanding the distinction is critical in **system design interviews** and for building secure applications.

## 1. What is Hashing?
**Hashing** is a one-way process that transforms input data (of any size) into a fixed-size output, called a **hash value** or **digest**.  
It is **irreversible**, meaning you cannot reconstruct the original input from the hash.

### Key Characteristics
- **Deterministic**: Same input → same output.  
- **Fixed Output Size**: Input can be 1 byte or 1 GB, output length is constant (e.g., 256 bits for SHA-256).  
- **Collision Resistance**: Hard to find two inputs that produce the same hash.  
- **Preimage Resistance**: Given a hash, infeasible to reverse it to the input.  
- **Avalanche Effect**: Small input changes drastically change the output.  
- **Fast Computation**: Efficient for large-scale use.  

### Common Algorithms
- **MD5** → Obsolete (broken).  
- **SHA-1** → Deprecated.  
- **SHA-256/SHA-3** → Secure, widely used.  
- **bcrypt / scrypt / Argon2** → Designed for password hashing (slow + salted).  

### Use Cases
- **Password Storage**: Store salted & hashed passwords instead of plaintext.  
- **Integrity Checks**: File checksums (e.g., software downloads).  
- **Digital Signatures**: Hash message before signing.  
- **Blockchain**: Links blocks securely using hash chains.  

 **Best Practice**: For password hashing, always use salt + slow functions (bcrypt, Argon2). Consider adding a "pepper" (a secret key stored separately).  



## 2. What is Encryption?
**Encryption** is a reversible process that transforms **plaintext** into **ciphertext** using a key.  
Decryption recovers the original data with the correct key.

### Key Characteristics
- **Reversible**: Requires correct key for decryption.  
- **Key Dependency**: Security depends on the secrecy of the key.  
- **Confidentiality**: Protects data from unauthorized access.  
- **Variable Output Size**: Ciphertext size grows with input.  

### Types of Encryption
1. **Symmetric Encryption**
   - Same key for encryption & decryption.  
   - Example: **AES-256** (fast, secure).  
   - Challenge: Secure key distribution.  

2. **Asymmetric Encryption**
   - Public key for encryption, private key for decryption.  
   - Example: **RSA, ECC**.  
   - Slower, used for key exchange, digital signatures.  

### Use Cases
- **Secure Communication**: HTTPS/TLS.  
- **Data Protection**: Disk encryption, encrypted databases.  
- **Key Exchange**: Asymmetric used to share symmetric keys.  
- **Digital Signatures**: Encrypt hash with private key to prove authenticity.  



## 3. Key Differences: Hashing vs Encryption

| Aspect               | Hashing                                 | Encryption                              |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**          | Integrity, verification                 | Confidentiality, secrecy                |
| **Reversibility**    | One-way (irreversible)                 | Two-way (reversible with key)           |
| **Output**           | Fixed-size digest                      | Variable-size ciphertext                |
| **Key Usage**        | No key (uses salt/pepper for passwords)| Requires key(s)                         |
| **Examples**         | SHA-256, bcrypt                        | AES, RSA                                |
| **Use Case**         | Password storage, checksums            | Secure communication, data protection   |
| **Performance**      | Very fast                              | Slower (especially asymmetric)          |
| **Analogy**          | Fingerprint: unique, can’t reconstruct | Locked box: key opens to original data  |



## 4. When Hashing and Encryption Work Together

Many secure systems combine both:  
- **Digital Signatures** → Message is hashed, then hash is encrypted with private key.  
- **TLS/HTTPS** → Uses asymmetric encryption to exchange keys, then symmetric encryption for data, plus hashing for integrity.  

This layered approach ensures confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity.  


## 5. Practical Considerations

### Hashing
- Always salt passwords before hashing.  
- Use slow, memory-hard algorithms (Argon2, bcrypt).  
- Never use MD5 or SHA-1 for security.  

### Encryption
- Use AES-256 for data-at-rest or in-transit.  
- Use RSA/ECC only for key exchange, not bulk data.  
- Protect encryption keys (e.g., with HSMs or KMS).  

### Common Mistakes
- Encrypting passwords instead of hashing them.  
- Using weak hash functions in security-critical systems.  
- Confusing integrity (hash) with confidentiality (encryption).  


## 6. Real-World Context

- **Interview Relevance**: Expect questions like *“How would you store user passwords securely?”* or *“Why not encrypt passwords instead of hashing?”*  
- **Practical Use**: Hashing → blockchain, password security; Encryption → HTTPS, VPNs, cloud storage.  
- **Modern Trends**:  
  - **Post-quantum encryption** to resist quantum attacks.  
  - **GPU-resistant hashing** (e.g., Argon2) to prevent brute-force.
