# GPUs & Parallel Computing

**Graphics Processing Units (GPUs)** have transformed modern computing.  
Originally built for rendering graphics, GPUs now power **AI training**, **scientific simulations**, **cryptocurrency mining**, and **big data analytics**.  

This article explains **GPU architecture**, how GPUs differ from CPUs, and their role in **parallel computing** — knowledge essential for **system design interviews** and **engineering practice**.



## 1. What is a GPU?

A **Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)** is a specialized processor optimized for **massively parallel tasks**.  
While a CPU focuses on executing a few complex instructions very quickly, a GPU executes **thousands of simpler operations simultaneously**.

- **CPUs** → Best at sequential workloads, complex control flow, and low-latency tasks.  
- **GPUs** → Best at parallel workloads (e.g., matrix operations, graphics, AI training).  

**Analogy**:  
- CPU = 10 expert chefs making one dish each with perfection.  
- GPU = 500 line cooks making thousands of identical burgers at once.



## 2. CPU vs GPU

| Aspect           | CPU                          | GPU                              |
|------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Cores**        | Few (4–16 powerful cores)    | Thousands of lightweight cores   |
| **Focus**        | Sequential execution         | Parallel execution               |
| **Cache**        | Large caches, branch prediction | Smaller caches, high memory bandwidth |
| **Latency**      | Low-latency, fast decisions  | High throughput, slower per-task |
| **Best For**     | OS tasks, business logic, single-thread speed | AI, graphics, HPC, big data    |



## 3. GPU Architecture

GPUs are designed for **parallel execution**:  

- **Cores** → Thousands, grouped into **Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs)** (NVIDIA) or **Compute Units (CUs)** (AMD).  
- **Memory Hierarchy**:  
  - **Global Memory (GDDR, HBM)** → High bandwidth, but high latency.  
  - **Shared Memory** → Fast, on-chip memory within each SM.  
  - **Registers** → Per-thread local storage.  
- **Thread Groups** → Managed in **warps** (NVIDIA, 32 threads) or **wavefronts** (AMD, 64 threads).  
- **SIMD Execution** → Single instruction applied to multiple data items.  
- **High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM)** → In advanced GPUs, provides >1 TB/s bandwidth, crucial for AI workloads.  

**Interview Tip**: Be able to describe how **warps/wavefronts** map to SIMD execution.



## 4. Parallel Computing with GPUs

Parallel computing = **doing many things at the same time**.  
GPUs are built for **data parallelism** → applying the same operation to many data points.  

### 4.1 Types of Parallelism
1. **Data Parallelism** → Same operation on multiple data elements (e.g., matrix multiplication).  
2. **Task Parallelism** → Different tasks run simultaneously (common in CPUs, less so in GPUs).  

### 4.2 GPU Programming Models
- **CUDA (NVIDIA)** → Parallel programming extensions for C/C++.  
- **OpenCL** → Cross-platform, works with GPUs and other accelerators.  
- **Graphics APIs (DirectX, OpenGL, Vulkan)** → For rendering tasks.  
- **Frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch, cuDNN)** → Abstract GPU programming for ML/AI.  

### 4.3 Execution Model
- **Thread Blocks** → Tasks grouped into blocks executed on SMs.  
- **SIMD Execution** → Same instruction executed across many data points.  
- **Latency Hiding** → Thousands of threads scheduled so that when some wait for memory, others run.  



## 5. Applications of GPUs

1. **Graphics & Rendering** → Games, CAD, 3D visualization.  
2. **AI & Machine Learning** →  
   - Training neural networks (massive matrix multiplications).  
   - Inference (deploying trained models).  
3. **Scientific Computing** → Simulations in physics, chemistry, biology, climate.  
4. **Cryptocurrency Mining** → Parallel hashing computations.  
5. **Data Analytics** → Big data queries, filtering, transformations.  
6. **Video Processing** → Encoding, decoding, real-time effects.  

**Interview Tip**: Always connect GPU applications to **parallelism**. For example, “Training a neural network is parallelizable because each neuron’s computations can be done simultaneously.”



## 6. Challenges of GPU Computing

- **Programming Complexity** → Efficient GPU code requires knowledge of memory coalescing, thread divergence, occupancy.  
- **Memory Bottlenecks** → Even with high-bandwidth memory, data transfer between CPU & GPU can be slow (PCIe bottleneck).  
- **Thread Divergence** → If threads in a warp take different branches, execution slows down.  
- **Power Consumption** → GPUs can consume 200–600W each, critical in data centers.  
- **Limited General-Purpose Use** → Not all workloads are parallelizable.  



## 7. GPU vs TPU

- **GPUs** → General-purpose parallel processors, flexible (graphics, AI, simulations).  
- **TPUs (Tensor Processing Units)** → Google’s accelerators, specialized for **matrix multiplications** in deep learning.  
- **Key Tradeoff** → GPUs = flexible, TPUs = more efficient but narrower scope.  

**Interview Tip**: Be ready to answer: “When would you choose a GPU over a TPU?”



## 8. Real-World Context

- **Interview Relevance**:  
  - Compare CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs.  
  - Discuss GPU bottlenecks (PCIe, memory).  
  - Explain SIMD execution.  

- **Engineering Use**:  
  - Training LLMs (e.g., GPT models).  
  - Rendering AAA games.  
  - HPC workloads (weather, genomics).  

- **Modern Trends**:  
  - **NVIDIA Hopper/Ampere** → Tensor cores for AI.  
  - **AMD RDNA/CDNA** → Competing HPC & graphics architectures.  
  - **Multi-GPU Systems (DGX, TPU Pods)** → Scale parallelism further.  
  - **Unified Memory (UMA)** → Emerging to reduce CPU–GPU data transfer bottlenecks.
