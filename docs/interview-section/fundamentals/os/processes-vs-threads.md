# Processes vs Threads

In operating systems, **processes** and **threads** are the basic units of execution.  
Understanding their differences is essential for **concurrency, parallelism, and system design interviews**.


## 1. What is a Process?

- A **process** is an **independent program in execution**.  
- It has its own **memory space, registers, stack, heap, and code segment**.  
- Examples:  
  - Opening Chrome → one process.  
  - Opening VS Code → another process.  

### Key Characteristics
- Heavyweight: context switching is expensive.  
- Isolated: one process cannot access another’s memory directly.  
- Communicates via **Inter-Process Communication (IPC)** → pipes, sockets, shared memory.  


## 2. What is a Thread?

- A **thread** is the **smallest unit of execution** within a process.  
- A process can have **multiple threads**, sharing the same memory space.  
- Example:  
  - Chrome process → one thread renders UI, another fetches network data.  

### Key Characteristics
- Lightweight: faster context switching.  
- Shares memory: threads of the same process share code, data, and heap.  
- Needs synchronization (locks, semaphores) to avoid race conditions.  


## 3. Memory Model Comparison

| Aspect       | Process                     | Thread                         |
|--------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Memory Space | Separate per process        | Shared within process          |
| Communication| IPC needed                  | Shared memory (direct access)  |
| Context Switch| Expensive                   | Cheaper                        |
| Failure      | One process crash isolated  | One thread crash may affect all|


## 4. Use Cases

- **Processes**:  
  - Isolation and security (Chrome tabs, database servers).  
  - Long-running independent programs.  

- **Threads**:  
  - Parallel tasks (multi-threaded servers).  
  - Real-time responsiveness (UI + background tasks).  


## 5. Processes vs Threads in Interviews

- Be ready to explain:  
  - Why web servers use **multi-threading** (to handle many requests).  
  - Why databases use **multi-process architecture** (for isolation).  
- Common pitfalls:  
  - Threads → race conditions.  
  - Processes → heavy context switching.  



## 6. Analogy

- **Process** = A house (with its own kitchen, bathroom, resources).  
- **Thread** = Roommates in the same house (sharing resources, but needing rules to avoid conflicts).
