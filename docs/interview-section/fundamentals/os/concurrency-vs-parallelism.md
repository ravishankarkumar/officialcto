# Concurrency vs Parallelism

Concurrency and parallelism are fundamental concepts in **system design** and **operating systems**.  
They are often confused, but they are **not the same thing**.

---

## 1. Concurrency

- Concurrency = **dealing with multiple tasks at once**.  
- Tasks may **start, run, and complete in overlapping time periods**.  
- Execution may not literally happen at the same time.  

**Example:**  
- A single-core CPU switching between tasks quickly (time-slicing).  
- Handling multiple client requests with async I/O.  

**Analogy:**  
- A single chef cooking multiple dishes by switching between them.

## 2. Parallelism

- Parallelism = **executing multiple tasks at the exact same time**.  
- Requires **multiple cores/CPUs**.  
- Focuses on **performance and speed**.  

**Example:**  
- A quad-core CPU running four threads simultaneously.  
- MapReduce splitting large jobs across many servers.  

**Analogy:**  
- Multiple chefs cooking different dishes at the same time.

## 3. Concurrency vs Parallelism Table

| Aspect          | Concurrency                          | Parallelism                        |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Definition      | Managing multiple tasks              | Executing tasks simultaneously     |
| Hardware Needed | Not required (can be single-core)    | Requires multi-core/multi-CPU      |
| Goal            | Better utilization & responsiveness  | Faster execution (performance)     |
| Example         | Async programming, goroutines        | Multi-threading, distributed jobs  |

## 4. Real-World Examples

- **Concurrency:**  
  - Node.js event loop handling thousands of requests.  
  - Chat server managing messages with async I/O.  

- **Parallelism:**  
  - Video encoding on multiple cores.  
  - Training ML models on GPU clusters.  

---

## 5. Interview Tips

- Common question: *“Is Node.js concurrent or parallel?”*  
  - Answer: Node.js is **concurrent (async I/O)**, but not parallel by default.  
- Be ready to mention that **concurrency ≠ parallelism**, but they can **co-exist**.  
  - Example: A multi-core server handling concurrent async requests → concurrency + parallelism.
