# Memory Management (Paging, Segmentation)

Memory management is a **core responsibility of the operating system (OS)**.  
It ensures efficient use of RAM, process isolation, and smooth execution of programs.  

---

## 1. Why Memory Management?

- Programs need memory to load code, store variables, and manage execution.  
- OS must:  
  - Allocate/deallocate memory fairly.  
  - Prevent one program from corrupting another’s memory.  
  - Handle cases when programs need more memory than available (virtual memory).  

---

## 2. Contiguous Memory Allocation

- Early OS → one program loaded at a time.  
- Later → multiple programs in memory simultaneously (multiprogramming).  
- Problem: **Fragmentation** (wasted memory).  

---

## 3. Paging

Paging solves fragmentation by breaking memory into **fixed-size blocks**.  

- **Frame** = fixed-size block in physical memory.  
- **Page** = fixed-size block in logical (virtual) memory.  
- OS keeps a **page table** to map virtual pages → physical frames.  

**Advantages:**  
- No external fragmentation.  
- Easy to swap pages between RAM and disk.  

**Disadvantages:**  
- Page table overhead.  
- Page faults → performance hit (disk access).  

**Example:**  
- Process needs 8KB, page size = 1KB → process divided into 8 pages.

## 4. Segmentation

Segmentation divides memory into **variable-sized segments** based on program logic.  

- **Code segment** → instructions.  
- **Data segment** → global variables.  
- **Stack segment** → function calls.  

**Advantages:**  
- Matches program structure.  
- Easier for compiler/programmer.  

**Disadvantages:**  
- Causes **external fragmentation**.  
- Complex memory allocation.

## 5. Paging vs Segmentation

| Aspect        | Paging                          | Segmentation                   |
|---------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Block Size    | Fixed (e.g., 4KB pages)         | Variable (depends on program)  |
| Fragmentation | Internal (last page partly empty)| External (holes in memory)     |
| Mapping       | Virtual page → physical frame   | Segment → memory block         |
| Programmer    | Invisible (done by OS)          | Visible (logical structure)    |

## 6. Virtual Memory

- Extends physical RAM by using **disk storage**.  
- Uses paging/segmentation to load only required parts of program.  
- Improves multitasking, but can cause **thrashing** if overused.  

---

## 7. Interview Tips

- Be ready to explain **page faults** and **thrashing**.  
- Compare **paging vs segmentation** (fixed vs variable).  
- Mention virtual memory → allows programs larger than RAM.  

**Analogy:**  
- Paging = slicing book into equal pages, store anywhere.  
- Segmentation = chapters of variable length, stored as-is.
