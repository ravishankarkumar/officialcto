# CI/CD Pipelines

## Overview
Welcome to the eighth lecture of **Section 8: Domain-Specific Topics (Cloud, Infra, and Beyond)** in the *Official CTO* journey! **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)** pipelines are essential for automating software delivery, ensuring fast, reliable deployments in distributed systems. In this 20-minute lesson, we explore **CI/CD pipelines**, focusing on automation using tools like GitHub Actions. With a YAML-based pipeline and a Java application example, we’ll prepare you for FAANG interviews and real-world projects. Drawing from my 8+ years of mentoring engineers, this lecture equips you to master deployment automation. Let’s continue your *Official CTO* journey to become a well-rounded engineer!

Inspired by *Continuous Delivery* and GitHub Actions/Jenkins documentation, this lesson provides actionable insights, code examples, and strategies for automation.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand **CI/CD pipelines** and their role in deployment automation.
- Learn to **implement pipelines** using GitHub Actions for distributed systems.
- Prepare for **FAANG interviews** with CI/CD-focused questions.
- Implement a **YAML-based pipeline** and **Java application** for deployment.

## Why CI/CD Pipelines Matter
CI/CD pipelines streamline software delivery, enabling rapid, reliable deployments critical for FAANG roles. Drawing from my experience mentoring engineers, I’ve seen expertise in CI/CD set candidates apart in interviews and leadership roles. This lecture ensures you can design automated pipelines, articulate their benefits, and align with industry trends.

In software engineering, CI/CD pipelines help you:
- **Ace Interviews**: Answer automation-related technical questions.
- **Automate Deployments**: Streamline software releases.
- **Ensure Reliability**: Catch issues early with testing.
- **Drive Efficiency**: Reduce manual deployment efforts.

## Key Concepts
### 1. Continuous Integration (CI)
- **Definition**: Automatically building and testing code changes to ensure integration.
- **Key Components**: Code commits, automated tests, build processes.
- **Tools**: GitHub Actions, Jenkins, CircleCI.
- **Use Case**: Run unit tests on every commit.

### 2. Continuous Deployment (CD)
- **Definition**: Automatically deploying validated code to production.
- **Key Components**: Deployment scripts, staging environments, rollback mechanisms.
- **Tools**: GitHub Actions, ArgoCD, Jenkins.
- **Use Case**: Deploy a microservice to Kubernetes.

### 3. CI/CD in Distributed Systems
- **Purpose**: Automate microservices deployment, testing, and scaling.
- **Components**: Build, test, containerize, deploy, monitor.
- **Benefits**: Speed, reliability, scalability.

### 4. Role in FAANG Interviews
- Technical questions test CI/CD knowledge (e.g., “Design a CI/CD pipeline for a microservice”).
- Behavioral questions assess experience (e.g., “Tell me about a time you automated a deployment”).
- Align with company priorities (e.g., Amazon’s AWS CodePipeline, Netflix’s Spinnaker).

## Code Example: GitHub Actions Pipeline for a Java Microservice
Below is a YAML-based GitHub Actions pipeline to build, test, and deploy a Java microservice, along with a sample Java application.

### GitHub Actions Pipeline (`.github/workflows/cicd.yml`)
```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up JDK 17
        uses: actions/setup-java@v3
        with:
          java-version: '17'
          distribution: 'temurin'

      - name: Build with Maven
        run: mvn clean package

      - name: Run tests
        run: mvn test

      - name: Build Docker image
        run: docker build -t my-app:${{ github.sha }} .

      - name: Log in to Docker Hub
        uses: docker/login-action@v2
        with:
          username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}

      - name: Push Docker image
        run: docker push my-app:${{ github.sha }}

  deploy:
    needs: build-and-test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Deploy to Kubernetes
        uses: azure/k8s-deploy@v4
        with:
          namespace: default
          manifests: k8s/deployment.yaml
          images: my-app:${{ github.sha }}
          kubectl-version: 'latest'
```

### Sample Java Microservice
```java
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@SpringBootApplication
public class MicroserviceApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(MicroserviceApplication.class, args);
    }
}

@RestController
class HealthController {
    @GetMapping("/health")
    public String healthCheck() {
        return "Service is healthy";
    }
}
```

- **Explanation**:
  - **GitHub Actions Pipeline**:
    - Triggers on push/pull requests to the `main` branch.
    - Builds and tests a Java app with Maven.
    - Containerizes the app with Docker and pushes to Docker Hub.
    - Deploys to Kubernetes using a manifest (assumes `k8s/deployment.yaml` exists).
  - **Java Microservice**:
    - A simple Spring Boot app with a `/health` endpoint.
    - Suitable for CI/CD deployment in a distributed system.
- **Setup**:
  - Add dependencies: `org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web`.
  - Store `DOCKER_USERNAME` and `DOCKER_PASSWORD` in GitHub Secrets.
  - Create a `k8s/deployment.yaml` (similar to Lecture 3) for Kubernetes deployment.
  - Run `mvn clean package` locally or via the pipeline.
- **Big O**: O(1) for pipeline steps; build/test time depends on app complexity.
- **Edge Cases**: Handles build failures, missing secrets, or Kubernetes errors.
- **Trade-Offs**: GitHub Actions for simplicity vs. Jenkins for customization; Docker for portability vs. direct deployment.

## Practice Exercise
**Problem**: Design a CI/CD pipeline for a Java microservice.
1. **Define Requirements**:
   - Build, test, and deploy a REST API to Kubernetes.
   - Ensure scalability and reliability.
2. **Craft a STAR Response**:
   - **Situation**: Describe a project needing automation (e.g., microservice deployment).
   - **Task**: Clarify your role (e.g., pipeline designer).
   - **Action**: List 2–3 actions (e.g., built pipeline, deployed to Kubernetes).
   - **Result**: Quantify outcomes (e.g., reduced deployment time, scaled users).
3. **Write a Pipeline**:
   - Create a GitHub Actions YAML file for build/test/deploy.
   - Test locally with `act` or deploy to GitHub.
4. **Tailor to a FAANG Company**:
   - Align with Amazon (CodePipeline), Google (Cloud Build), Meta (speed), or Netflix (autonomy).
5. **Write and Review**:
   - Write a 100–150 word STAR response.
   - Ensure clarity, specificity, and alignment with CI/CD concepts.

**Sample Response (Netflix - Freedom & Responsibility)**:
- **Situation**: “Our microservice needed faster deployments.”
- **Task**: “As lead, I was responsible for automation.”
- **Action**: “I independently designed a GitHub Actions pipeline to build, test, and deploy to Kubernetes.”
- **Result**: “We doubled release frequency, supporting 100,000 users.”
