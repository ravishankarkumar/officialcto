# Design Instagram/Social Media Photo Sharing

## Overview
A social media photo-sharing system, like Instagram, allows users to upload photos and view personalized feeds of images from accounts they follow. In this tenth lesson of Section 5 in the *Official CTO* journey, we explore the **high-level design of a photo-sharing system**, covering functional requirements (uploading photos, generating feeds), non-functional requirements (scalability, low latency, availability), and trade-offs (storage, fanout vs. read-time aggregation). Whether building a photo-sharing platform or a social app, this design ensures robust performance. By mastering this, you’ll architect scalable Java systems and mentor others effectively.

Inspired by *Clean Architecture*, *Designing Data-Intensive Applications*, and *System Design Interview*, this 25-minute lesson covers the concepts, a practical Java example with a system architecture diagram, and practice exercises to advance your skills. Let’s continue the journey to becoming a better engineer!

## Learning Objectives
- Understand **functional** (photo upload, feed generation) and **non-functional** (scalability, latency, availability) requirements for a photo-sharing system.
- Learn to design an **Instagram-like system** in Java, addressing components and trade-offs.
- Apply **OOP principles** (Section 2, Lecture 1), **UML** (Section 2, Lecture 2), **design principles** (Section 4), and **HLD concepts** (Section 5, Lectures 1-9) to system design.
- Design scalable Java systems with clean code practices (Section 9).

## Why Photo-Sharing System Design Matters
Photo-sharing systems are core to social media platforms, requiring efficient storage, fast feed generation, and high scalability for millions of users. Early in my career, I designed a photo-sharing system for a social app, optimizing for low latency with caching and fanout for scalability. This design—balancing functionality and performance—is a staple in FAANG system design interviews. Explaining it clearly showcases your mentorship skills.

In software engineering, photo-sharing system design helps you:
- **Handle Scale**: Support millions of users with distributed storage.
- **Ensure Low Latency**: Optimize feed generation with caching and fanout.
- **Manage Trade-Offs**: Balance storage costs and real-time updates.
- **Teach Effectively**: Share scalable design strategies.

## Key Concepts
### 1. Functional Requirements
- **Upload Photo**: Users upload images with metadata (e.g., caption, timestamp).
- **Generate Feed**: Display a personalized feed of photos from followed accounts.
- **Optional**: Support likes, comments, and stories.

### 2. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Scalability**: Handle billions of photos and millions of requests/day.
- **Low Latency**: <200ms for feed generation.
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime with fault tolerance.
- **Storage Efficiency**: Optimize for image storage (e.g., object storage).

### 3. System Components
- **Client**: Browser/mobile app for uploading and viewing feeds.
- **API**: REST endpoints for photo upload and feed retrieval.
- **Load Balancer**: Distributes traffic (e.g., Nginx).
- **Application Server**: Handles logic (e.g., Java Spring Boot).
- **Object Storage**: Stores images (e.g., S3).
- **Database**: Stores metadata and relationships (e.g., Cassandra).
- **Cache**: Speeds up feed generation (e.g., Redis).
- **Message Queue**: Manages fanout (e.g., Kafka).

### 4. Trade-Offs
- **Fanout vs. Read-Time**:
  - **Write-Time Fanout**: Precompute feeds by pushing photos to followers (fast reads, high write cost).
  - **Read-Time Aggregation**: Fetch photos on-demand (low write cost, slow reads).
- **Storage**: Object storage (scalable) vs. database (simpler queries).
- **CAP Theorem**: Prioritize AP (availability, partition tolerance) for feed access.

### 5. Relation to Previous Sections
- **OOP** (Section 2, Lecture 1): Encapsulation and polymorphism modularize components.
- **UML** (Section 2, Lecture 2): Diagrams visualize architecture.
- **Design Principles** (Section 4): SoC (Lecture 11) separates upload and feed generation; KISS (Lecture 8) simplifies logic.
- **HLD Concepts**:
  - Components (Section 5, Lecture 1): Map to API, storage, cache.
  - Requirements (Section 5, Lecture 2): Drive scalability and latency goals.
  - Scaling (Section 5, Lecture 3): Use sharding and caching.
  - Security/Performance (Section 5, Lecture 4): Ensure low latency with caching.
  - Distributed Systems (Section 5, Lecture 5): Handle partitioning and availability.
  - URL Shortener (Section 5, Lecture 6): Similar storage and ID generation.
  - Pastebin (Section 5, Lecture 7): Similar storage and retrieval patterns.
  - Web Crawler (Section 5, Lecture 8): Similar queuing and scalability challenges.
  - Twitter Feed (Section 5, Lecture 9): Similar fanout and feed generation.

### 6. Use Case
Design a photo-sharing system for a social media platform to upload images and generate personalized feeds, ensuring scalability and low latency.

## System Design
### Architecture
```
[Client (Browser/Mobile)] --> [Load Balancer (Nginx)] --> [Application Server (Spring Boot)]
                                                          |
                                                          |--> [Object Storage (S3)]
                                                          |--> [Database (Cassandra)]
                                                          |--> [Cache (Redis)]
                                                          |
                                                       [Queue (Kafka, Fanout)]
```

- **Uploading a Photo**:
  1. Client uploads image via POST `/photo`.
  2. Application server stores image in S3, metadata in Cassandra.
  3. Push photo to followers’ feeds via Kafka (write-time fanout).
  4. Cache metadata for fast access.
- **Generating a Feed**:
  1. Client requests feed via GET `/feed`.
  2. Check Redis for precomputed feed; if missed, query Cassandra.
  3. Return sorted feed (e.g., by timestamp).
- **Scalability**: Shard Cassandra by user ID; replicate for availability.
- **Performance**: Cache feeds in Redis; use fanout for fast reads.
- **Trade-Offs**: Write-time fanout (high write cost) vs. read-time aggregation (slow reads).

### Trade-Offs
- **Fanout Strategy**: Write-time fanout (fast reads, high storage) vs. read-time aggregation (low storage, slow reads).
- **Storage**: S3 for images (scalable) vs. database for metadata (fast queries).
- **Caching**: Redis for feed caching (fast) vs. no caching (high database load).

## Code Example: Photo-Sharing Service
Let’s implement a simplified Java photo-sharing service with write-time fanout and caching.

    }
    
    public void uploadPhoto(String photoId, String userId, String imageUrl, String caption) {
        Photo photo = new Photo(photoId, userId, imageUrl, caption, System.currentTimeMillis());
        storage.saveImage(photoId, imageUrl);
        repository.savePhoto(photo);
        cache.cacheFeed(userId, List.of(photo)); // Cache user's own photo
        
        // Write-time fanout: Push to followers
        List<String> followerList = followers.getOrDefault(userId, new ArrayList<>());
        for (String follower : followerList) {

        if (cachedFeed != null) {
            return cachedFeed;
        }
        
        // Fallback to read-time aggregation

}

public class PhotoController {
    private final PhotoService service;
    
    public PhotoController(PhotoService service) {
        this.service = service;
    }
    
    public void handleUploadPhoto(String photoId, String userId, String imageUrl, String caption) {
        service.uploadPhoto(photoId, userId, imageUrl, caption);

        // Saving photo to Cassandra: photo1
        // Caching feed in Redis for user: user1

```
- **System Design and Principles**:
  - **Functional**: `uploadPhoto` stores images and metadata; `getFeed` generates personalized feeds.
  - **Non-Functional**:
    - **Scalability**: `CassandraPhotoRepository` shards by user ID; S3 for image storage.
    - **Low Latency**: `RedisCache` stores precomputed feeds.
    - **Availability**: Cassandra with replication.
  - **Fanout**: Write-time fanout pushes photos to followers’ caches.
  - **Encapsulation**: Private fields with public methods.
  - **Abstraction**: `PhotoRepository` interface for storage.
  - **Clean Code**: Meaningful names, modularity (Section 9).
  - **Design Principles**: SoC (Section 4, Lecture 11) separates upload and feed generation; DIP (Section 4, Lecture 6) for abstractions.
- **Big O**: O(1) for `uploadPhoto` (average case), O(n) for `getFeed` read-time aggregation (n = followed users).
- **Edge Cases**: Handles missing users, empty feeds with fallbacks.

**Systematic Approach**:
- Clarified requirements (upload photos, generate feeds, ensure scalability).
- Designed system architecture diagram to show API, storage, caching, and fanout.
- Implemented Java code for a photo-sharing service, addressing requirements and trade-offs.
- Tested with `main` method for photo upload and feed retrieval.

## Real-World Application
Imagine designing a photo-sharing system for a social media platform to deliver personalized feeds, using write-time fanout for low-latency feed generation, S3 for scalable image storage, and Cassandra for metadata. A system architecture diagram communicates the design to stakeholders, ensuring performance and reliability. This design—paired with principles like KISS (Section 4, Lecture 8) and patterns like Facade (Section 3, Lecture 8)—demonstrates your ability to mentor teams on scalable photo-sharing design.

## Practice Exercises
Design a photo-sharing system or similar with these exercises:
- **Easy**: Design a system architecture diagram and Java code for a `PhotoService` with basic upload and retrieval.
- **Medium**: Create a diagram and Java code for a `SocialPhotoService` with read-time feed aggregation.
- **Medium**: Design an HLD for a photo-sharing system with sharding, caching, and fanout, implementing a Java controller.
- **Hard**: Architect a photo-sharing system with S3, Cassandra, and Kafka, supporting likes and comments, using a Java service.

Try designing one system in Java with a diagram, explaining how requirements and trade-offs are addressed.

## Conclusion
Designing an Instagram-like photo-sharing system equips you to architect scalable, low-latency Java systems for social platforms. By mastering this design, you’ll optimize performance, ensure reliability, and teach others effectively. This advances your progress in Section 5 of the *Official CTO* journey.
