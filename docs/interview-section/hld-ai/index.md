# High-Level System Design: Architecting Scalable Systems

## Overview
High-Level System Design (HLD) focuses on architecting scalable, reliable systems, defining components like APIs, load balancers, databases, and caching layers to meet functional and non-functional requirements. This section’s **38 lessons** cover foundational concepts, 25 real-world system design problems, and advanced topics like distributed systems and trade-offs, equipping you to excel in FAANG interviews. Whether designing a scalable e-commerce platform or a real-time notification system for a social app, HLD skills ensure robust, performant architectures. By mastering HLD, you’ll create scalable Java systems and mentor others effectively.

Inspired by *Clean Architecture*, *Designing Data-Intensive Applications*, and *System Design Interview*, this section emphasizes practical Java applications, covering essential concepts for professional system design. Each lesson includes real-world examples, diagrams, and practice exercises to advance your skills in the *Official CTO* journey to becoming a better engineer.

## Learning Objectives
- Master **HLD components** (APIs, load balancers, databases) for scalable systems.
- Learn to design **real-world systems** (e.g., URL shortener, social media feed).
- Understand **scalability, reliability, and trade-offs** (e.g., CAP theorem, sharding).
- Apply **OOP principles** (Section 2, Lecture 1), **design patterns** (Section 3), and **design principles** (Section 4) to HLD.
- Design robust Java systems with clean code practices (Section 9).
