# Polyglot Persistence & System Design Patterns

Modern applications rarely rely on a single type of database.  
Instead, they use **polyglot persistence** — choosing the **best database for each workload** within the same system.  

This approach is common in large-scale systems like Netflix, Uber, and Instagram.

---

## 1. What is Polyglot Persistence?

- **Polyglot persistence** = Using **multiple databases** in one system.  
- Each database is chosen based on workload:  
  - Relational DB for transactions.  
  - NoSQL for scalability.  
  - Specialized DB for search, caching, or time-series.  

**Analogy**: Just as you use different tools in a workshop (hammer, screwdriver, wrench), you use different databases for different tasks.

---

## 2. Why Polyglot Persistence?

- **Workload Diversity**: Different modules have different needs (transactions vs analytics vs search).  
- **Scalability**: Specialized databases handle large-scale workloads better.  
- **Cost Optimization**: Avoid overloading a single expensive database.  
- **Flexibility**: Adopt new technologies without rewriting the whole system.

## 3. Real-World Examples

### Netflix
- **Cassandra** → for user viewing history (write-heavy).  
- **MySQL** → for billing and financial records (ACID).  
- **Elasticsearch** → for search and recommendations.  

### Uber
- **MySQL** → core trips and payments.  
- **Cassandra** → geospatial + high-write workloads.  
- **Redis** → caching and session management.  
- **Elasticsearch** → log search and analytics.  

### Instagram
- **PostgreSQL** → core relational data.  
- **Memcached** → caching.  
- **Elasticsearch** → full-text search.

## 4. Common Polyglot Patterns

### 4.1 Transactional + Analytical Split
- **Transactional DB (OLTP)**: Fast inserts/updates (Postgres, MySQL).  
- **Analytical DB (OLAP)**: Complex queries (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift).  

👉 Example: E-commerce site uses MySQL for orders, Snowflake for sales analysis.

---

### 4.2 Search + Relational
- **Relational DB**: User accounts, product catalog.  
- **Search Engine**: Full-text search (Elasticsearch).  

👉 Example: Amazon uses RDBMS for structured data + Elasticsearch for product search.

---

### 4.3 Cache + Primary DB
- **Cache (Redis/Memcached)**: Serve hot data.  
- **Relational/NoSQL DB**: Source of truth.  

👉 Example: Twitter caches timelines in Redis, stores data in MySQL/Cassandra.

---

### 4.4 Hybrid Event-Driven
- **Event Store (Kafka/EventStore)**: Capture system events.  
- **Multiple Databases** consume events for specialized storage.  

👉 Example: Banking system streams events →  
  - Cassandra (audit logs)  
  - Postgres (transactions)  
  - Elasticsearch (fraud detection).  

---

## 5. Challenges in Polyglot Persistence

- **Data Consistency**: Harder to keep multiple DBs in sync.  
- **Increased Complexity**: More moving parts = harder operations.  
- **Operational Overhead**: Monitoring, backups, and scaling each DB separately.  
- **Latency Trade-offs**: Syncing across DBs may add delays.  

👉 Requires **careful system design** and often **event-driven architectures**.

---

## 6. Interview Tips

When asked *“Which database would you choose?”*:  
- Don’t restrict yourself to just SQL or NoSQL.  
- Show awareness of **polyglot persistence**.  
- Tie DB choice to workload.  

👉 Example Answer:  
*“For an e-commerce system, I’d use a relational DB for orders and payments, a document DB for product catalog, and Elasticsearch for search. To improve scalability, I’d add Redis for caching. This is polyglot persistence — using the right tool for each workload.”*

## 7. Recap

- **Polyglot persistence** = using multiple DBs in one system.  
- Real-world companies (Netflix, Uber, Instagram) rely on it.  
- Common patterns:  
  - Transactional + Analytical split.  
  - Search + Relational.  
  - Cache + Primary DB.  
  - Event-driven hybrids.  
- Challenges: data consistency, complexity, ops overhead.  
- Interview: Always justify DB choice by workload.
