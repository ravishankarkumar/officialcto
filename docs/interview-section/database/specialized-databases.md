# Specialized Databases

Not all workloads fit neatly into **SQL vs NoSQL**.  
Over time, specialized databases have evolved to solve **specific problems at scale**.  

This article explains the major categories: **Key-Value, Document, Wide-Column, Graph, Search, and Time-Series.**

---

## 1. Key-Value Databases

### Concept
- Simplest data model: `key ‚Üí value`.  
- Works like a giant **hashmap** across distributed nodes.  
- Example entry:  
  ```
  "user:123" ‚Üí {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}
  ```

### Examples
- Redis  
- Amazon DynamoDB  
- Riak  

### Strengths
- Very fast O(1) lookups.  
- Scales horizontally.  
- Simple and lightweight.  

### Weaknesses
- No complex queries (joins, filters).  
- Limited analytics.  

### Use Cases
- Caching (Redis).  
- Session management.  
- User profiles.  

---

## 2. Document Databases

### Concept
- Stores **semi-structured data** as documents (JSON/BSON).  
- Each document can have flexible fields.  

Example (MongoDB):
```json
{
  "user_id": 123,
  "name": "Alice",
  "orders": [
    {"id": 1, "item": "Book"},
    {"id": 2, "item": "Laptop"}
  ]
}
```

### Examples
- MongoDB  
- Couchbase  
- Firebase Firestore  

### Strengths
- Flexible schema.  
- Natural fit for object-oriented applications.  
- Rich queries (filters, aggregations).  

### Weaknesses
- Joins are expensive.  
- Can lead to data duplication.  

### Use Cases
- Content management systems.  
- E-commerce catalogs.  
- Mobile & web apps with evolving schemas.  

---

## 3. Wide-Column Databases

### Concept
- Data stored in **column families** instead of rows.  
- Inspired by Google Bigtable.  
- Rows can have variable columns.  

Example (Cassandra):
```
UserID | Name   | Orders:2023 | Orders:2024
-------+--------+-------------+-------------
123    | Alice  | 3           | 5
```

### Examples
- Apache Cassandra  
- HBase  
- ScyllaDB  

### Strengths
- Great for large-scale write-heavy workloads.  
- Good for time-series or event logging.  
- Tunable consistency (choose strong or eventual).  

### Weaknesses
- Complex to manage.  
- Querying flexibility limited vs SQL.  

### Use Cases
- Event logging (IoT, telemetry).  
- Real-time analytics.  
- Messaging systems (write-heavy).  

---

## 4. Graph Databases

### Concept
- Data stored as **nodes** and **edges** with properties.  
- Focus on relationships and graph traversals.  

Example:
```
(Alice) -[FRIEND]-> (Bob)
(Bob)   -[WORKS_AT]-> (CompanyX)
```

### Examples
- Neo4j  
- JanusGraph  
- ArangoDB  

### Strengths
- Optimized for relationship-heavy data.  
- Supports graph algorithms (shortest path, PageRank).  

### Weaknesses
- Poor for bulk analytics.  
- Steeper learning curve.  

### Use Cases
- Social networks (friends, followers).  
- Recommendation engines.  
- Fraud detection (transaction graphs).  

---

## 5. Search Engines

### Concept
- Specialized for **text search & retrieval**.  
- Uses inverted indexes to map terms ‚Üí documents.  
- Supports ranking, fuzzy search, autocomplete.  

### Examples
- Elasticsearch  
- Apache Solr  
- OpenSearch  

### Strengths
- Full-text search capabilities.  
- Fast filtering & ranking.  
- Rich analytics.  

### Weaknesses
- Not ideal as primary data store.  
- Requires tuning (indexing, relevancy).  

### Use Cases
- Product search.  
- Log analytics (ELK stack).  
- Site-wide search engines.  

---

## 6. Time-Series Databases

### Concept
- Optimized for storing **time-stamped data**.  
- Efficient compression + queries by time range.  

### Examples
- InfluxDB  
- TimescaleDB (Postgres extension)  
- Prometheus  

### Strengths
- Efficient storage of time-series.  
- Built-in aggregation functions.  
- Integrates with monitoring/observability stacks.  

### Weaknesses
- Narrow use-case.  
- Not for relational data.  

### Use Cases
- Metrics & monitoring (server CPU, memory).  
- IoT sensor data.  
- Financial tick data.

## 8. Interview Tips

- **Don‚Äôt just say ‚ÄúNoSQL‚Äù** ‚Äî specify which type.  
  - *‚ÄúFor product catalog ‚Üí Document DB.‚Äù*  
  - *‚ÄúFor social graph ‚Üí Graph DB.‚Äù*  
  - *‚ÄúFor real-time metrics ‚Üí Time-series DB.‚Äù*  

- Show awareness that **polyglot persistence** (using multiple DBs together) is common.  

üëâ Example Answer:  
*‚ÄúFor a social media system, I‚Äôd use a relational DB for users and payments, a graph DB for friendships, and Elasticsearch for search. This is polyglot persistence ‚Äî using the right tool for each workload.‚Äù*
