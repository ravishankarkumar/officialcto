# Database Series: From Fundamentals to Scale

Databases are the backbone of every scalable system.  
Whether you’re preparing for **high-level design (HLD) interviews** or building **real-world distributed systems**, understanding how databases work — and how they scale — is essential.

This series is structured to take you from **basics → advanced → real-world case studies**, so you can follow it like a course or jump directly to the topic you need.
