# Component Cohesion Principles (REP, CCP, CRP)

## Introduction

In software architecture, **cohesion** refers to how well the elements within a module or component belong together.  
At the **class level**, cohesion ensures each class has one focused responsibility.  
At the **component level** (modules, packages, microservices), cohesion determines:

- **How reusable** a component is across systems.  
- **How resilient** it is to change.  
- **How independently** it can evolve without ripple effects.  

Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob) identified three key principles that define *component-level cohesion*:

1. **REP ‚Äì Reuse/Release Equivalence Principle**  
2. **CCP ‚Äì Common Closure Principle**  
3. **CRP ‚Äì Common Reuse Principle**  

These principles guide architects in deciding *which classes belong together* and *how components should be structured* for long-term maintainability and scalability.

## 1. REP ‚Äì Reuse/Release Equivalence Principle

> **‚ÄúThe unit of reuse is the unit of release.‚Äù**

### Concept

A component cannot truly be reusable unless it is **independently releaseable** ‚Äî with its own versioning, distribution, and release lifecycle.

Think of software like Lego blocks.  
Each block (component) can only be reused easily if it‚Äôs shaped and standardized correctly ‚Äî that‚Äôs what **REP** demands.

### Why REP Matters

- Encourages **formal versioning** and controlled releases.  
- Prevents the ‚Äúcopy-paste‚Äù anti-pattern of sharing source code.  
- Promotes **stability and consistency** across teams or systems.  

Without REP, teams end up duplicating code and losing track of which version of a library is being used ‚Äî making debugging and upgrades painful.

### ‚úÖ Example: Good REP in Java

```java
// Payment module packaged as a reusable JAR
module com.officialcto.payment {
    exports com.officialcto.payment.api;
}

// Public API
package com.officialcto.payment.api;

public interface PaymentProcessor {
    void charge(Order order);
}
```

Here, the payment module:
- Has a defined API surface.  
- Can be versioned (e.g., 1.0.0, 1.1.0).  
- Can be reused by multiple services independently.

### ‚ùå Violating REP

```java
// Payment logic scattered across modules
public class StripeHelper { ... }
public class RazorpayUtils { ... }
public class PaymentValidator { ... }
```

These classes are scattered, unversioned, and tightly coupled ‚Äî not releaseable as a single unit.

### üîç Quick REP Checklist
- [ ] Can this component be versioned and released independently?  
- [ ] Does it have clear release notes or API documentation?  
- [ ] Are its dependencies clearly defined and stable?  

---

## 2. CCP ‚Äì Common Closure Principle

> **‚ÄúClasses that change for the same reasons should be grouped together.‚Äù**

### Concept

The **CCP** ensures that when a requirement changes, only **one component** needs to be modified.  
It extends the **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)** to the component level.

In other words:
> If two classes usually change together, they belong together.

### Why CCP Matters

- Minimizes **ripple effects** when making changes.  
- Keeps **build times and testing effort** localized.  
- Enhances **maintainability** ‚Äî a single change = one component rebuild.  

### ‚úÖ Example: Good CCP

```java
// Order domain module
public class Order { ... }
public class OrderValidator { ... }
public class OrderRepository { ... }
public class OrderService { ... }
```

All order-related classes are grouped together.  
If business rules for orders change, only this component is affected.

### ‚ùå Violating CCP

```java
// Scattered across modules
public class Order { ... }         // in core module
public class OrderValidator { ... } // in utils module
public class OrderRepository { ... } // in repository module
```

Now, a single change in order logic impacts multiple modules, creating friction and regression risk.

### üß† Analogy
Imagine a restaurant kitchen where the chef, stove, and ingredients are in separate rooms. Every change in the recipe requires coordination across rooms ‚Äî inefficient and error-prone.  
CCP says: *Keep everything needed for a specific recipe together.*

### üîç Quick CCP Checklist
- [ ] Do all classes in this component change for the same reason?  
- [ ] Does a requirement change trigger multiple component builds?  
- [ ] Can one team own and modify this component without cross-team coordination?  

---

## 3. CRP ‚Äì Common Reuse Principle

> **‚ÄúClasses that are used together should be packaged together.‚Äù**

### Concept

If two classes are *always reused together*, they should be in the same component.  
If not, keep them separate ‚Äî otherwise, consumers are forced to depend on things they don‚Äôt need.

This principle focuses on **dependency hygiene**.

### Why CRP Matters

- Prevents **unnecessary dependencies** and bloated imports.  
- Keeps **build and deploy cycles** fast.  
- Makes components lightweight and focused.  

### ‚ùå Violating CRP

```java
// Utility package (bad cohesion)
public class StringUtils { ... }
public class FileUtils { ... }
public class NetworkUtils { ... }
```

A user who only needs `StringUtils` is forced to import and depend on `FileUtils` and `NetworkUtils` too ‚Äî adding unnecessary baggage.

### ‚úÖ Following CRP

Break it into separate components:

```
string-utils.jar
file-utils.jar
network-utils.jar
```

Now, consumers pick only what they need ‚Äî lightweight, decoupled, and flexible.

### üß† Analogy
Buying a *combo meal* when you only wanted fries wastes resources and money.  
CRP tells us: *Package only what users always consume together.*

### üîç Quick CRP Checklist
- [ ] Do consumers of one class always use the others in this component?  
- [ ] Are unnecessary dependencies being introduced?  
- [ ] Would splitting this module make it easier to maintain or reuse?

## ‚öñÔ∏è Balancing REP, CCP, and CRP

These principles often **pull in different directions**:

| Principle | Encourages | Risk if Over-Applied |
|------------|-------------|----------------------|
| **REP** | Larger components | Harder to modify quickly |
| **CCP** | Group by reason to change | Components may grow large |
| **CRP** | Smaller components | Too many micro-modules, hard to manage |

### Visualizing the Tension

  CCP[CCP: Change Isolation] -->|Pushes| Focused[Focused Domain Modules]
  CRP[CRP: Dependency Hygiene] -->|Pushes| Small[Smaller, Reusable Parts]
```

Finding the **sweet spot** is the art of component design.  
Well-balanced systems minimize change impact while maximizing reuse.

## üß™ Real-World Case Studies

### 1. Android SDK
- **REP:** Released as versioned SDKs (API 30, 31‚Ä¶).  
- **CCP:** Related APIs (e.g., UI widgets) grouped together.  
- **CRP:** Networking, storage, and UI packages separated.  

### 2. Spring Framework
- **REP:** Entire Spring stack versioned (e.g., 5.x, 6.x).  
- **CCP:** Spring Web, Spring Data, and Spring Security are logically grouped.  
- **CRP:** Developers can import only `spring-web` without pulling `spring-data`.  

### 3. Amazon Microservices
- **REP:** Each service is versioned independently.  
- **CCP:** Each domain (Orders, Inventory, Payments) is isolated.  
- **CRP:** Teams depend only on APIs they actually consume.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Violation | Impact |
|----------|------------|--------|
| **God Modules** | CRP | Forces consumers to depend on unrelated code |
| **Over-Fragmentation** | REP | Too many small modules, heavy release management |
| **Scattered Domain Logic** | CCP | Changes ripple across multiple components |

---

## üß© Extended Java Case Study

### Scenario: Payment & Order Services

#### ‚ùå Bad Design
```java
// payment scattered across utils and repositories
public class PaymentHelper { ... }
public class PaymentUtils { ... }
public class OrderRepository { ... } // also has payment logic
```
- Payment logic spread across unrelated modules.  
- Hard to reuse or version as one unit.  
- Changes ripple through the system.

#### ‚úÖ Good Design
```java
// Payment module
public interface PaymentProcessor { void charge(Order order); }
public class StripeProcessor implements PaymentProcessor { ... }
public class RazorpayProcessor implements PaymentProcessor { ... }

// Order module
public class Order { ... }
public class OrderService { ... }
public class OrderValidator { ... }
```

**Results:**
- Payment module = independently releasable (REP).  
- Order module = isolated from unrelated changes (CCP).  
- Consumers depend only on what they need (CRP).

## üí¨ Interview Prep

**Q1:** What are the component cohesion principles?  
**A:** REP, CCP, and CRP ‚Äî they define how to group classes into stable, reusable components.

**Q2:** How do REP and CRP conflict?  
**A:** REP encourages larger, stable components; CRP encourages smaller, reusable ones. Architects must balance them contextually.

**Q3:** Example of CCP in action?  
**A:** Grouping all order-related logic in one module so business rule changes affect only that component.

**Q4:** What happens when CRP is violated?  
**A:** Consumers depend on unnecessary code, creating bloated dependency graphs.

**Q5:** How do these apply in microservices?  
**A:** Each microservice should group logic that changes together (CCP), be versioned independently (REP), and avoid exposing unneeded APIs (CRP).

## üß≠ Key Takeaways

| Principle | Essence | Goal |
|------------|----------|------|
| **REP** | Reuse = Release | Enables reuse through independent versioning |
| **CCP** | Change Together | Minimizes ripple effects from change |
| **CRP** | Use Together | Prevents unnecessary dependencies |

> Balancing these three is the hallmark of a modular, maintainable architecture.
