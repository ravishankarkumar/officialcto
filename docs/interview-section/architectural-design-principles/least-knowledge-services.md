# Principle of Least Knowledge at Service Boundaries

## Introduction
In large-scale distributed systems, **services must collaborate** to fulfill business workflows.  
However, if services know too much about each other’s internals, the system becomes fragile:  
- A change in one service breaks others.  
- Deployments require coordination.  
- Teams lose autonomy.  

To prevent this, architects apply the **Principle of Least Knowledge** (also known as the **Law of Demeter**) at **service boundaries**.  
The rule: **A service should only talk to its direct collaborators through stable contracts, and know as little as possible about others.**  

---

## Why the Principle of Least Knowledge Matters
1. **Reduced Coupling** – Services interact through narrow, stable contracts.  
2. **Team Autonomy** – Each team can evolve its service without ripple effects.  
3. **Resilience** – Failures are contained; fewer dependencies mean fewer breakages.  
4. **Security** – Internal details remain hidden, minimizing attack surfaces.  

---

## The Law of Demeter Refresher (Class Level)
At the class level, **Law of Demeter** says:  
- Don’t chain too many calls (`a.getB().getC().doSomething()`).  
- Instead, interact with direct collaborators.  

At the **system level**, this translates to:  
- Don’t expose one service’s internals (schema, nested objects) to others.  
- Only expose what’s necessary via APIs.  

---

## Bad Example – Violating the Principle
```java
// OrderService calling PaymentService internals
public class OrderService {
    private PaymentService paymentService;

    public void placeOrder(Order order) {
        paymentService.getPaymentRepository()
                      .getPaymentGateway()
                      .charge(order);
    }
}
```

❌ OrderService knows about repository + gateway internals of PaymentService.  
❌ Any internal refactor in PaymentService breaks OrderService.  

---

## Good Example – Following the Principle
```java
// Contract exposed by PaymentService
public interface PaymentService {
    void charge(Order order);
}

// OrderService only depends on the contract
public class OrderService {
    private final PaymentService paymentService;
    public OrderService(PaymentService paymentService) {
        this.paymentService = paymentService;
    }
    public void placeOrder(Order order) {
        paymentService.charge(order);
    }
}
```

✅ OrderService only knows about `charge()`.  
✅ Payment internals hidden.  
✅ Payment team can refactor freely.  

---

## Service Boundaries in Microservices

### Anti-Pattern: Shared Database
- OrderService queries Payment DB directly.  
- Tight coupling to schema.  

### Correct Pattern: API Boundary
- OrderService calls Payment API `/charge`.  
- Schema hidden behind API.  

---

## Real-World Case Studies

### 1. Amazon
- Teams not allowed to access each other’s DB.  
- APIs enforced as boundaries.  
- Result: Teams scale independently.  

### 2. Netflix
- Recommendation service doesn’t query Viewing DB directly.  
- Talks to Viewing API.  
- Ensures independence and resilience.  

### 3. Banking Systems
- Compliance APIs expose only what’s required.  
- Internal rules hidden.  
- Prevents accidental violations.  

---

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Leaky APIs**
   - Expose DB schema or nested objects.  
   - Violates least knowledge.  

2. **Chatty APIs**
   - Require too many fine-grained calls.  
   - Leads to performance issues.  

3. **Tight Coupling via Libraries**
   - Services share the same internal library.  
   - Breaks independence.  

---

## Extended Java Case Study

### Without Least Knowledge
```java
// InventoryService exposes nested structures
public class InventoryService {
    public InventoryRepository getRepository() { return repo; }
}

// OrderService chained calls into Inventory internals
orderService.getInventoryService()
            .getRepository()
            .getStockDAO()
            .checkStock(id);
```

❌ OrderService depends on Inventory internals.  

### With Least Knowledge
```java
// InventoryService contract
public interface InventoryService {
    boolean hasStock(String productId);
}

// OrderService depends only on the API
public class OrderService {
    private final InventoryService inventoryService;
    public OrderService(InventoryService inventoryService) {
        this.inventoryService = inventoryService;
    }
    public void placeOrder(Order order) {
        if (inventoryService.hasStock(order.getId())) { ... }
    }
}
```

✅ OrderService only depends on `hasStock()`.  
✅ Inventory can refactor internals freely.

## Interview Prep

### Q1: *What is the Principle of Least Knowledge?*  
**Answer:** A service should only talk to its direct collaborators via stable contracts, and not depend on internal details of other services.  

### Q2: *Why is it important in microservices?*  
**Answer:** Prevents tight coupling across services, enabling team autonomy and independent evolution.  

### Q3: *What’s an example of violating it?*  
**Answer:** Service A querying Service B’s database directly.  

### Q4: *How can you enforce it in Java?*  
**Answer:** Define contracts via interfaces or APIs, hide implementation details, and avoid exposing nested structures.  

### Q5: *What’s the relationship with Law of Demeter?*  
**Answer:** Law of Demeter at class level → Least Knowledge at system/service level. Both reduce coupling by avoiding dependency on indirect details.

## Visualizing Least Knowledge
```mermaid
graph TD
  A[Order Service] -->|charge()| B[Payment API]
  B --> C[(Payment DB)]
  A -.->|Does NOT see DB| C
```

✅ Order talks only to Payment API.  
✅ Payment DB hidden.  

---

## Key Takeaways
- **Principle of Least Knowledge** = services should only depend on minimal, stable contracts.  
- Prevents fragile coupling across services.  
- Builds resilience, autonomy, and security.  
- Strongly enforced at Amazon, Netflix, and banks.
