# Architectural Design Patterns

## Overview
**Design patterns** are proven solutions to recurring architectural challenges. Unlike principles, which are conceptual, patterns are concrete blueprints you can apply in practice.

This section covers classic and modern patterns — from layered architecture to CQRS and strangler fig — with Java-first examples, diagrams, and case studies.

## Lessons

1. **Layered (Tiered) Architecture Pattern**  
   Classic 3-tier and n-tier designs.  
   [Start Lesson →](/interview-section/architectural-design-patterns/layered-architecture)

2. **Hexagonal (Ports & Adapters) Architecture Pattern**  
   Keeping business logic independent.  
   [Start Lesson →](/interview-section/architectural-design-patterns/hexagonal-architecture)

3. **Onion Architecture Pattern**  
   Domain-centric design with concentric rings.  
   [Start Lesson →](/interview-section/architectural-design-patterns/onion-architecture)

4. **Microservices vs Modular Monolith**  
   When to split a monolith, Conway’s Law.  
   [Start Lesson →](/interview-section/architectural-design-patterns/microservices-vs-monolith)

5. **Event-Driven Architecture Pattern**  
   Decoupling services with asynchronous events.  
   [Start Lesson →](/interview-section/architectural-design-patterns/event-driven-architecture)

6. **Event Sourcing Pattern**  
   Capturing state changes as immutable events.  
   [Start Lesson →](/interview-section/architectural-design-patterns/event-sourcing-pattern)

7. **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) Pattern**  
   Separating reads from writes.  
   [Start Lesson →](/interview-section/architectural-design-patterns/cqrs-pattern)

8. **Saga Pattern**  
   Distributed transactions via orchestration or choreography.  
   [Start Lesson →](/interview-section/architectural-design-patterns/saga-pattern)

9. **Strangler Fig Pattern**  
   Incrementally replacing legacy systems.  
   [Start Lesson →](/interview-section/architectural-design-patterns/strangler-fig)

10. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**  
    Preventing cascading failures.  
    [Start Lesson →](/interview-section/architectural-design-patterns/circuit-breaker)

11. **API Gateway / Backend for Frontend (BFF) Pattern**  
    Single entry point, client-specific facades.  
    [Start Lesson →](/interview-section/architectural-design-patterns/api-gateway-bff)

12. **Database per Service Pattern**  
    Microservices owning their data.  
    [Start Lesson →](/interview-section/architectural-design-patterns/database-per-service)
