# Horizontal vs Vertical Scaling

Scaling is at the heart of high-level design (HLD).  
When traffic grows, you must decide: **scale up (vertical scaling)** or **scale out (horizontal scaling)**.

---

## 1. Vertical Scaling (Scale Up)

### What It Is
- Increase capacity of a single server.  
- Add more CPU, RAM, storage, or faster hardware.  

### Advantages
- Simple to implement (no code changes).  
- Works well for small-scale systems.  
- Useful for short-term bottlenecks (e.g., DB out of memory).  

### Disadvantages
- Expensive at higher levels (diminishing returns).  
- Hardware limits (there’s always a max size).  
- Single point of failure (SPOF).  
- No redundancy by default.  

### Examples
- Upgrading DB from 8GB RAM → 64GB RAM.  
- Adding faster SSDs to improve IO performance.

## 2. Horizontal Scaling (Scale Out)

### What It Is
- Add more servers (nodes) to handle traffic.  
- Workload distributed via load balancing.  

### Advantages
- Virtually unlimited scaling (add more nodes).  
- High availability (if one node fails, others still serve traffic).  
- Commodity hardware (cheaper than giant servers).  
- Foundation for microservices, cloud-native systems.  

### Disadvantages
- Requires distributed systems design (stateless apps, data sharding).  
- Load balancing complexity.  
- Harder debugging/monitoring.  
- Consistency challenges.  

### Examples
- Web servers behind load balancer.  
- Database read replicas.  
- Sharding large datasets across nodes.

## 3. Vertical vs Horizontal — Comparison

| Feature            | Vertical Scaling                  | Horizontal Scaling                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| How it works       | Bigger machine (scale up)         | More machines (scale out)          |
| Complexity         | Low                               | High (distributed systems needed)  |
| Cost               | Expensive at scale                | Scales with commodity hardware     |
| Fault tolerance    | Single point of failure           | High availability with redundancy  |
| Limits             | Hardware cap                      | Near-infinite (practically)        |

## 4. Real-World Strategies

- **Start with vertical scaling** → simplest way to remove bottlenecks.  
- Once limits are hit → **move to horizontal scaling**.  
- Often combined:  
  - DB vertically scaled (bigger instance) + horizontally scaled (read replicas).  
  - Web tier horizontally scaled with load balancers.  

---

## 5. Interview Tips

- Always mention both options: *“I’d first scale vertically, but once I hit limits, I’d move to horizontal scaling.”*  
- Acknowledge complexity of horizontal scaling (state management, sharding).  
- Bring up **SPOF** when describing vertical scaling.  
- Mention **load balancing** and **replication** for horizontal scaling.
