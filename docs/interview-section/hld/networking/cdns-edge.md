# CDNs & Edge Computing

When applications need to serve **global users**, network latency and reliability become critical.  
Even with powerful servers, requests traveling across continents add hundreds of milliseconds.  

**CDNs (Content Delivery Networks)** and **Edge Computing** solve this by pushing content and computation **closer to users**.

---

## 1. CDNs (Content Delivery Networks)

A CDN is a **geographically distributed network of edge servers** that cache and deliver content.

### Key Features
- **Static content caching**: HTML, CSS, JS, images, video.  
- **Dynamic content acceleration**: optimize routing for APIs.  
- **DDoS protection**: absorb traffic surges.  
- **Global routing**: send users to nearest edge server.  

### Examples
- Cloudflare, Akamai, AWS CloudFront, Fastly, Vercel, Netlify.

## 2. Edge Computing

Edge computing takes CDN a step further: not just caching, but **executing logic at the edge**.

### What it means
- Run computation closer to the user.  
- Reduce round-trips to origin server.  
- Useful for personalization, security, and latency-sensitive workloads.

### Examples
- **Cloudflare Workers**: run JavaScript at the edge.  
- **AWS Lambda@Edge**: serverless compute at CloudFront edges.  
- **Fastly Compute@Edge**: WASM-powered edge compute.

## 3. Benefits of CDNs & Edge Computing

- **Lower latency**: serve from nearest location.  
- **Higher availability**: multiple edge nodes reduce SPOF.  
- **Scalability**: absorb sudden spikes (viral content, flash sales).  
- **Cost savings**: reduce load on origin servers.  
- **Security**: DDoS mitigation, WAF at edge.  

---

## 4. Use Cases

- **Static websites** → CDN edge nodes serve all assets.  
- **Streaming services** → cache video segments at edges.  
- **E-commerce** → edge logic for localization, currency, personalization.  
- **APIs** → cache GET responses, run authentication at edge.  
- **IoT & real-time apps** → process data at edge before central aggregation.  

---

## 5. Pitfalls & Trade-offs

- **Cache invalidation** → stale content if not purged correctly.  
- **Dynamic personalization** → harder to cache (per-user responses).  
- **Debugging** → edge logic harder to test locally.  
- **Vendor lock-in** → each provider has unique APIs.

## 6. CDN vs Edge — Quick Contrast

| Feature           | CDN                           | Edge Computing                  |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Focus             | Caching content               | Running logic near users        |
| Primary Benefit   | Latency + offload origin      | Personalization, real-time, low-latency |
| Examples          | CloudFront, Akamai, Fastly    | Cloudflare Workers, Lambda@Edge |

## 7. Interview Tips

- Always mention CDNs for **global scalability**.  
- Bring up edge computing for **personalization, real-time processing, security**.  
- Show awareness of **cache invalidation trade-offs**.  
- Mention that CDNs/edges are **complementary to load balancing**.
