# Eventual vs Strong Consistency

Consistency is a core challenge in **distributed systems**. When data is replicated across multiple nodes, we must decide **how quickly updates become visible** and what guarantees we can provide to clients.

This article explores the difference between **strong consistency** and **eventual consistency**, trade-offs, and real-world use cases.

---

## 1. What is Consistency?

In distributed databases and systems, **consistency** refers to the **view of data across replicas**.

- **Strong consistency** → All clients always see the latest committed value.  
- **Eventual consistency** → Clients may see stale data, but replicas **converge eventually**.  

Consistency is at odds with **availability and partition tolerance** (see [CAP Theorem](/interview-section/database/cap-theorem.md)).

---

## 2. Strong Consistency

### Definition
After a write is acknowledged, **all subsequent reads will see the latest value**.

### Example
- Write `X=5` to DB.  
- Any read after that → returns `5`.  
- Achieved via synchronous replication, quorum reads/writes.

### Advantages
- Simple mental model for developers.  
- Ensures correctness in financial/critical apps.  
- No stale reads.

### Disadvantages
- High latency due to coordination (quorum, locks).  
- Lower availability during network partitions.  
- Expensive in geo-distributed systems.

### Use Cases
- Banking & financial transactions.  
- Inventory management.  
- Leader election in consensus algorithms.

## 3. Eventual Consistency

### Definition
After a write, **not all replicas are immediately updated**. Over time, replicas will converge to the same state.

### Example
- Write `X=5` to one replica.  
- Another client reads from a lagging replica → may still see old value `X=3`.  
- Eventually, replication catches up, all replicas show `5`.

### Advantages
- High availability (writes succeed locally).  
- Low latency.  
- Scales well in geo-distributed systems.

### Disadvantages
- Clients may observe stale or inconsistent data.  
- Developers must handle anomalies (duplicate updates, read-after-write issues).

### Use Cases
- Social media feeds.  
- Product catalogs.  
- DNS systems.

## 4. Causal & Tunable Consistency (Middle Ground)

Many systems offer **tunable consistency**:  
- **Quorum-based reads/writes (N, R, W model):**  
  - N = total replicas, R = read replicas, W = write replicas.  
  - If R + W > N → strong consistency.  
  - Else → eventual consistency.  
- **Causal consistency:** ensures cause-effect order (if A happens before B, all clients agree).  

Examples: DynamoDB, Cassandra, CosmosDB.

## 5. Real-World Examples

- **Strong Consistency:**  
  - Google Spanner (global clock, Paxos).  
  - ZooKeeper (leader-based consensus).  

- **Eventual Consistency:**  
  - DynamoDB (default mode).  
  - Cassandra (AP-first).  
  - DNS (eventual propagation of records).

## 6. Trade-offs

| Aspect            | Strong Consistency | Eventual Consistency |
|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Latency           | Higher (due to coordination) | Lower |
| Availability      | Lower (may reject writes) | Higher |
| Complexity        | Easier for developers | Harder (must handle anomalies) |
| Scalability       | Limited | Excellent |

## 7. Interview Tips

- When asked: *“Which consistency model will you choose?”* →  
  Always clarify **use case**:  
  - Banking → strong.  
  - Social media → eventual.  
- Bring up **CAP theorem**: can’t have perfect consistency + availability in a partition.  
- Mention **tunable consistency** as a practical solution.  
- Use real-world examples (Spanner, DynamoDB).
