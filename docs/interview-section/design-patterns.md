# Design Patterns: Reusable Solutions for Scalable Systems

## Overview
Design patterns are time-tested, reusable solutions to common software design problems, enabling modular, maintainable, and scalable code. This section’s **15 lessons** dive into the Gang of Four (GoF) patterns and modern patterns like Dependency Injection, equipping you to build elegant Java systems. Whether implementing a notification system for a social app or a payment processor for an e-commerce platform, these patterns enhance your design skills. By mastering design patterns, you’ll create robust software and mentor others effectively.

Inspired by *Design Patterns* by Gang of Four, *Head First Design Patterns*, and *Clean Code*, this section emphasizes practical Java implementations, covering creational, structural, and behavioral patterns. Each lesson includes real-world examples and practice exercises to advance your skills in the *Official CTO* journey to becoming a better engineer.

## Learning Objectives
- Master **creational patterns** (e.g., Singleton, Factory) for object creation.
- Learn **structural patterns** (e.g., Adapter, Decorator) for object composition.
- Apply **behavioral patterns** (e.g., Strategy, Observer) for dynamic behavior.
- Design **scalable systems** using patterns, UML, and clean code (Sections 2, 9).

## Lessons
1. **Introduction to Design Patterns** (15 min)  
   Explore the purpose and types of design patterns (creational, structural, behavioral). Example: Overview of patterns in a social app.

2. **Singleton Pattern** (15 min)  
   Learn the Singleton pattern for single-instance objects. Example: Logger for an e-commerce platform.  
   [Start Lesson →](/interview-section/design-patterns/singleton-pattern)

3. **Factory Method Pattern** (20 min)  
   Use Factory Method to create objects flexibly. Example: Payment processor factory for a retail app.  
   [Start Lesson →](/interview-section/design-patterns/factory-method-pattern)

4. **Abstract Factory Pattern** (20 min)  
   Apply Abstract Factory for families of related objects. Example: UI components for a travel platform.

5. **Builder Pattern** (20 min)  
   Master the Builder pattern for complex object construction. Example: Order builder for an e-commerce system.  
   [Start Lesson →](/interview-section/design-patterns/builder-pattern)

6. **Adapter Pattern** (15 min)  
   Use Adapter to bridge incompatible interfaces. Example: Integrate legacy payment APIs in a modern app.  
   [Start Lesson →](/interview-section/design-patterns/adapter-pattern)

7. **Decorator Pattern** (20 min)  
   Apply Decorator to extend functionality dynamically. Example: Add features to a notification system.  
   [Start Lesson →](/interview-section/design-patterns/decorator-pattern)

8. **Facade Pattern** (15 min)  
   Simplify complex subsystems with Facade. Example: Unified API for a booking system.  
   [Start Lesson →](/interview-section/design-patterns/facade-pattern)

9. **Composite Pattern** (20 min)  
   Use Composite for hierarchical structures. Example: File system representation in a cloud app.  
   [Start Lesson →](/interview-section/design-patterns/composite-pattern)

10. **Strategy Pattern** (20 min)  
    Master Strategy for interchangeable algorithms. Example: Sorting strategies for a product catalog.  
    [Start Lesson →](/interview-section/design-patterns/strategy-pattern)

11. **Observer Pattern** (20 min)  
    Apply Observer for event-driven systems. Example: User notifications in a social app.  
    [Start Lesson →](/interview-section/design-patterns/observer-pattern)

12. **Command Pattern** (20 min)  
    Use Command to encapsulate actions. Example: Undoable operations in a text editor.  
    [Start Lesson →](/interview-section/design-patterns/command-pattern)

13. **Template Method Pattern** (15 min)  
    Learn Template Method for algorithm skeletons. Example: Workflow for a payment processor.  
    [Start Lesson →](/interview-section/design-patterns/template-method-pattern)

14. **Dependency Injection** (20 min)  
    Explore Dependency Injection for loose coupling. Example: Inject services in a cloud system.  
    [Start Lesson →](/interview-section/design-patterns/dependency-injection)

15. **Mock Interview: Applying Patterns** (30 min)  
    Practice applying multiple patterns in a mock interview. Example: Design a notification system combining patterns.  
    [Start Lesson →](/interview-section/design-patterns/mock-interview-patterns)
