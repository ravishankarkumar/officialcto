# Documentation and Code Reviews

## Overview
Welcome to the seventh and final lecture of **Section 9: Writing Clean Code** in the *Official CTO* journey! **Effective documentation** and **code reviews** are critical for ensuring code quality, collaboration, and maintainability in FAANG environments. In this 20-minute lesson, we explore best practices for documentation (e.g., Javadoc, READMEs, *Code Complete 2* Ch. 32) and code reviews (*Code Complete 2* Ch. 21, Google’s Java Style Guide), using a Java-based example of a portfolio management service for a fintech app. Drawing from my 8+ years of mentoring engineers, this lecture equips you to excel in FAANG interviews and real-world projects. Let’s complete your *Official CTO* journey in Section 9 with mastery!

Inspired by *Clean Code* by Robert C. Martin, *Code Complete 2*, and FAANG code review practices, this lesson provides actionable insights and a practical example.

## Learning Objectives
- Master **effective documentation** with Javadoc and READMEs.
- Learn **code review best practices** for collaboration and quality.
- Prepare for **FAANG interviews** with documentation and review-focused questions.
- Apply documentation in a **portfolio management service** example.

## Why Documentation and Code Reviews Matter
Documentation and code reviews ensure code is understandable, maintainable, and aligned with team standards, making them essential for FAANG interviews. Drawing from my experience mentoring engineers, I’ve seen these practices distinguish candidates in code reviews and leadership roles. This lecture ensures you can document code effectively, conduct impactful reviews, and align with industry standards.

In software engineering, documentation and code reviews help you:
- **Ace Interviews**: Demonstrate clarity in code reviews and documentation tasks.
- **Reduce Technical Debt**: Clarify intent and simplify maintenance.
- **Enhance Collaboration**: Enable teams to understand and improve code.
- **Improve Quality**: Catch issues early through reviews.

## Key Concepts
### 1. Effective Documentation
- **Definition**: Clear, concise documentation (e.g., Javadoc, READMEs) to explain code intent (*Code Complete 2* Ch. 32).
- **Guidelines**: Use Javadoc for methods/classes, write READMEs for project setup, avoid redundant comments.
- **Example**: Document a portfolio management service’s API endpoints.

### 2. Code Review Best Practices
- **Definition**: Collaborative process to improve code quality (*Code Complete 2* Ch. 21).
- **Guidelines**: Focus on clarity, correctness, and maintainability; provide constructive feedback; follow style guides (e.g., Google’s Java Style Guide).
- **Example**: Review a fintech app’s code for readability and modularity.

### 3. Role in FAANG Interviews
- Technical questions test documentation (e.g., “Document this function”).
- Behavioral questions assess review experience (e.g., “Tell me about a time you improved code via reviews”).
- Align with company priorities (e.g., Google’s clarity, Amazon’s ownership).

### 4. Relation to Previous Sections
- **Algorithms** (Section 1): Documentation clarifies algorithmic logic.
- **OOD** (Section 2): Aligns with cohesive class documentation.

```java
/**
 * Manages investment portfolios, providing methods to calculate portfolio value and add investments.
 */
public class PortfolioManager {
    private final InvestmentRepository investmentRepository;
    private final MarketDataService marketDataService;

    /**
     * Constructs a PortfolioManager with dependencies for investment storage and market data.
     *
     * @param investmentRepository Repository for storing investment data
     * @param marketDataService Service for retrieving market prices
     */
    public PortfolioManager(InvestmentRepository investmentRepository, MarketDataService marketDataService) {
        this.investmentRepository = investmentRepository;
        this.marketDataService = marketDataService;
    }

    /**
     * Calculates the total value of a portfolio based on current market prices.
     *
     * @param portfolioId Unique identifier of the portfolio
     * @return PortfolioResult with the total value or an error message
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if portfolioId is invalid
     */
    public PortfolioResult calculatePortfolioValue(long portfolioId) {
        if (portfolioId <= 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid portfolio ID");
        }

        List<Investment> investments = investmentRepository.findInvestmentsByPortfolioId(portfolioId);
        if (investments.isEmpty()) {
            return new PortfolioResult(false, 0.0, "No investments found");
        }

        double totalValue = 0.0;
        for (Investment investment : investments) {
            double currentPrice = marketDataService.getCurrentPrice(investment.getAssetId());
            totalValue += currentPrice * investment.getQuantity();
        }
        return new PortfolioResult(true, totalValue, "Portfolio value calculated");
    }
}

/**
 * Represents an investment in a portfolio.
 */
public class Investment {
    private final long assetId;
    private final double quantity;

    /**
     * Constructs an Investment with asset ID and quantity.
     *
     * @param assetId Unique identifier of the asset
     * @param quantity Number of units held
     */
    public Investment(long assetId, double quantity) {
        this.assetId = assetId;
        this.quantity = quantity;
    }

    public long getAssetId() {
        return assetId;
    }

    public double getQuantity() {
        return quantity;
    }
}

/**
 * Represents the result of a portfolio operation.
 */
public class PortfolioResult {
    private final boolean isSuccessful;
    private final double value;
    private final String message;

    /**
     * Constructs a PortfolioResult with success status, value, and message.
     *
     * @param isSuccessful Whether the operation was successful
     * @param value The calculated portfolio value
     * @param message Descriptive message for the result
     */
    public PortfolioResult(boolean isSuccessful, double value, String message) {
        this.isSuccessful = isSuccessful;
        this.value = value;
        this.message = message;
    }

    public boolean isSuccessful() {
        return isSuccessful;
    }

    public double getValue() {
        return value;
    }

    public String getMessage() {
        return message;
    }
}

interface InvestmentRepository {
    List<Investment> findInvestmentsByPortfolioId(long portfolioId);
}

interface MarketDataService {
    double getCurrentPrice(long assetId);
}
```

# Portfolio Management Service

## Overview
This service manages investment portfolios, providing functionality to calculate portfolio value based on market prices. It is designed for scalability and maintainability, adhering to clean code principles.

## Setup
1. **Prerequisites**: Java 17+, Maven.
2. **Dependencies**: Configure `InvestmentRepository` (e.g., DynamoDB) and `MarketDataService` (e.g., external API).
3. **Run**: `mvn clean install && mvn exec:java`.

## Usage
- Call `PortfolioManager.calculatePortfolioValue(portfolioId)` to compute total value.
- Ensure valid `portfolioId` to avoid exceptions.

## Testing
- Run unit tests: `mvn test`.
- Mock dependencies using Mockito for `InvestmentRepository` and `MarketDataService`.

## Contact
