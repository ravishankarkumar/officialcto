# Design a Matchmaking Engine

## Overview
Welcome to the twenty-ninth lecture of **Section 6: Low-Level System Design** in the *Official CTO* journey! Designing a matchmaking engine is a practical LLD problem that tests your ability to pair users efficiently using OOP principles. In this 25-minute lesson, we explore the **low-level design of a matchmaking engine**, covering player matching (e.g., based on skill level) and queue management to ensure fair and timely pairings. Whether building a gaming platform or preparing for FAANG interviews, this lecture equips you to design modular, scalable systems. Let’s dive into LLD and continue the journey to becoming a better engineer!

Inspired by *Clean Architecture*, *Design Patterns*, and *Refactoring*, this lesson provides a practical Java example with a UML diagram and practice exercises, aligning with OOP principles and industry standards.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand **low-level design** principles for a matchmaking engine with player matching and queue management.
- Learn to model **classes**, **relationships**, and **functionality** in Java.
- Apply **OOP principles** (Section 2, Lecture 1), **design patterns** (Section 3), **design principles** (Section 4), and **HLD concepts** (Section 5) to LLD.
- Write clean, modular Java code (Section 9).

## Why Matchmaking Engine Design Matters
A matchmaking engine is a common FAANG interview problem that tests your ability to model user pairing and queue management, critical for gaming or social platforms. Drawing from my experience designing social and game systems, I’ve applied OOP principles to ensure scalability and fairness in similar applications. This lecture prepares you to design robust systems and articulate your approach clearly, showcasing your mentorship skills.

In software engineering, matchmaking engine design helps you:
- **Model User Pairing**: Match players based on criteria like skill.
- **Manage Queues**: Ensure efficient and fair pairing.
- **Ensure Scalability**: Handle large player pools.
- **Teach Effectively**: Share practical LLD strategies.

## Key Concepts
### 1. Matchmaking Engine Components
- **Player Matching**: Pair players based on criteria (e.g., skill level, latency).
- **Queue Management**: Manage players waiting to be matched.
- **Functionality**:
  - Add players to a matchmaking queue.
  - Match players based on criteria.
  - Remove players from the queue after matching.
- **Edge Cases**: Insufficient players, mismatched criteria, queue timeouts.

### 2. Design Patterns
- **Strategy Pattern** (Section 3, Lecture 4): For different matching algorithms.
- **Observer Pattern** (Section 3, Lecture 6): For notifying match results.
- **Singleton Pattern** (Section 3, Lecture 1): For matchmaking engine instance (optional).

### 4. Use Case
Design a matchmaking engine for a gaming platform, supporting player matching based on skill level and queue management for timely pairings.

## System Design
### Architecture
```
[Client] --> [MatchmakingController]
                |
                v
            [MatchmakingService]
                |
                v
           [MatchmakingEngine] --> [Player]
           [MatchQueue]
```

- **Classes**:
  - `Player`: Represents a player with attributes like ID and skill level.
  - `MatchQueue`: Manages players waiting for matches.
  - `MatchmakingEngine`: Handles matching logic and queue operations.
  - `MatchmakingService`: Implements business logic for matching.
  - `MatchmakingController`: Exposes API for operations.
- **Functionality**: Add players to queue, match based on skill, return match results.
- **Trade-Offs**:
  - Matching: Skill-based (fair, complex) vs. FIFO (simple, less fair).
  - Queue: In-memory (fast, volatile) vs. persistent (reliable, slower).

## Code Example: Matchmaking Engine
Below is a Java implementation of a matchmaking engine with player matching and queue management.

        controller.handleFindMatch(10); // Insufficient players
        controller.handleGetMatch("invalid"); // Non-existent match
        // Output:
        // Added player: player1 with skill level: 100
        // Added player: player2 with skill level: 105
        // Added player: player3 with skill level: 200
        // Created match: match-<timestamp>
        // Match ID: match-<timestamp>, Players: 2

```
- **LLD Principles**:
  - **Player Matching**: `MatchmakingEngine` pairs players based on skill level difference.
  - **Queue Management**: `MatchQueue` stores players awaiting matches.
  - **Classes**: `Player`, `Match`, `MatchQueue`, `MatchmakingEngine`, `MatchmakingService`, `MatchmakingController`.
  - **Design Patterns**: Strategy (matching algorithms), Observer (extensible for match notifications).
  - **Clean Code**: Meaningful names, modularity (Section 9).
  - **Design Principles**: SoC (Section 4, Lecture 11) separates queue and matching logic; DIP (Section 4, Lecture 6) for extensibility.
- **Big O**: O(n²) for `findMatch` (n = queued players, worst-case pair search); O(1) for `addPlayer`, `getMatch`.
- **Edge Cases**: Handles invalid skill levels, insufficient players, non-existent matches.

**UML Diagram**:
```
[Client] --> [MatchmakingController]
                |
                v
            [MatchmakingService]
                |
                v
           [MatchmakingEngine]
                |
                v
           [Player] --> [Match]
           [MatchQueue]
```

## Real-World Application
Imagine designing a matchmaking engine for a gaming platform, pairing players based on skill levels for fair matches. This LLD—aligned with HLD principles from Section 5 (e.g., Social Network Graph, Lecture 29)—ensures scalability and fairness, critical for gaming systems.

## Practice Exercises
Practice matchmaking engine design with these exercises:
- **Easy**: Design a UML diagram and Java code for a simple matchmaking queue.
- **Medium**: Implement a matchmaking engine with basic skill-based matching.
- **Medium**: Design an LLD for a matchmaking engine with queue management and matching criteria.
- **Hard**: Architect a matchmaking engine with Java, integrating multiple design patterns (e.g., Strategy, Observer).

Try designing one system in Java with a UML diagram, explaining player matching and queue management.

## Conclusion
Mastering the design of a matchmaking engine equips you to build modular, scalable Java systems, enhancing your LLD skills. This lecture builds on HLD concepts and social system principles, preparing you for FAANG interviews and real-world applications.
