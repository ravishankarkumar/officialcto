# Computer Science fundamentals for Tech Interviews

This section covers the **fundamental building blocks of computer systems** and modern computing essentials.  
It’s designed to give you the **baseline knowledge** required for **HLD/LLD interviews** and to strengthen your overall **engineering awareness**.  

From **networking basics → operating systems → CPUs & GPUs → AI concepts → security**, this hub ensures you’re equipped to connect low-level fundamentals with high-level system design.

::: info
Computer Science is a very wide field. We are covering bare minimum that will help you in interviews. Please read proper books if you want to become expert at CS fundamentals.

Also, if you are short on time, you may skip these sections. They are low priority.
