# Architectural Design Principles: Structuring Large-Scale Systems

## Overview
While **code-level design principles** (like SOLID, DRY, KISS) guide how to write clean classes and methods, **architectural design principles** focus on **structuring entire systems**: modules, components, services, and layers.  
These principles ensure that as systems grow, they remain scalable, maintainable, and adaptable to change. Mastering them prepares you for **senior engineering roles** and **system design interviews**.

This section draws from *Clean Architecture* (Robert Martin), *Domain-Driven Design* (Eric Evans), and *Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture* (Martin Fowler). Each lesson includes explanations, Java-inspired examples, and interview prep scenarios.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the **Dependency Rule** and layered architectures.
- Apply **component cohesion and coupling principles** to avoid brittle designs.
- Use **DDD concepts** like bounded contexts for domain clarity.
- Design for **scalability, modularity, and security**.
- Recognize trade-offs and evolution strategies in real-world systems.

## Lessons

<!-- 1. **Introduction to Architectural Design Principles**  
   Why architectural principles differ from code-level ones, and why they matter at scale.
