# Architectural Design Principles

## Overview
**Design principles** are timeless guidelines for structuring software systems. They provide direction on how to separate concerns, reduce coupling, and design for scalability and resilience. Unlike patterns (which are concrete solutions), principles are conceptual rules that inform architectural choices.

These lessons cover essential principles from *Clean Architecture*, *Domain-Driven Design*, and SRE practices — each explained with Java-first examples and interview prep.
