# Mock Interview: Live OOD Session

## Overview
Object-oriented design (OOD) interviews test your ability to translate real-world problems into modular, scalable systems under time pressure. In this eighth and final lesson of Section 2 in the *Official CTO* journey, we simulate a **live OOD interview** by designing a library management system, applying OOP principles, UML modeling, concurrency, and refactoring. Whether preparing for a FAANG interview or designing a real system like a book checkout platform, this lesson equips you with practical skills. By mastering OOD interviews, you’ll design robust Java systems and communicate effectively.

Inspired by *Head First Design Patterns*, *Clean Code*, and *Java Concurrency in Practice*, this 30-minute lesson walks through the interview process, a practical Java implementation with a UML diagram, and practice exercises to prepare you for success. Let’s wrap up Section 2 and continue the journey to becoming a better engineer!

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the **OOD interview process** (requirements, design, implementation, trade-offs).
- Apply **OOP principles** (Lecture 1), **UML** (Lecture 2), **concurrency** (Lecture 4), and **refactoring** (Lecture 7).
- Design a **library management system** with thread-safe operations.
- Practice clear communication for interview scenarios.

## Why OOD Interviews Matter
OOD interviews assess your ability to design modular systems and explain your thought process, a critical skill for senior engineers. Early in my career, I aced an OOD interview by designing a library system, using UML to clarify requirements and Java to implement thread-safe operations. This approach—combining OOP, UML, concurrency, and refactoring—demonstrates technical depth and communication skills. Mastering OOD interviews prepares you for real-world challenges and showcases your mentorship abilities.

In software engineering, OOD interviews help you:
- **Demonstrate Design Skills**: Build modular, scalable systems.
- **Communicate Clearly**: Explain designs to interviewers or teams.
- **Handle Complexity**: Incorporate concurrency and refactoring.
- **Prepare for Success**: Excel in FAANG and industry interviews.

## Key Concepts
### 1. OOD Interview Process
- **Clarify Requirements**: Understand system scope (e.g., book checkout, user management).
- **Design UML**: Model classes, relationships, and behaviors (Lecture 2).
- **Implement in Code**: Write clean, thread-safe Java code (Lectures 1, 4, 7).
- **Discuss Trade-Offs**: Balance performance, maintainability, and extensibility (Lecture 7).
- **Explain Clearly**: Articulate design decisions concisely.

### 2. Review of Section 2 Concepts
- **OOP Principles** (Lecture 1): Encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction.
- **UML Modeling** (Lecture 2): Class diagrams for relationships and structure.
- **Concurrency** (Lecture 4): Thread-safe operations with `ReentrantLock`, `ConcurrentHashMap`.
- **Refactoring** (Lecture 7): Eliminate code smells for maintainability.

### 3. Library System Requirements
- **Functionality**: Add/remove books, checkout/return books, track users, handle concurrent requests.
- **Classes**: `Book`, `User`, `Library`, `LibraryService`.
- **Constraints**: Thread-safe operations, extensible for new features.

## Code Example: Library Management System
Let’s simulate an OOD interview by designing a thread-safe library management system in Java, with a UML class diagram.

### Java Implementation
```java
import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

// User class
public class User {
    private int userId;
    private String name;
    
    public User(int userId, String name) {
        this.userId = userId;
        this.name = name;
    }
    
    public int getUserId() {
        return userId;
    }
    
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
}

// Book class
public class Book {
    private int bookId;
    private String title;
    private boolean isAvailable;
    private User borrowedBy;
    
    public Book(int bookId, String title) {
        this.bookId = bookId;
        this.title = title;
        this.isAvailable = true;
        this.borrowedBy = null;
    }
    
    public synchronized void checkout(User user) {
        if (isAvailable) {
            isAvailable = false;
            borrowedBy = user;
        } else {
            throw new IllegalStateException("Book " + bookId + " is not available");
        }
    }
    
    public synchronized void returnBook() {
        if (!isAvailable) {
            isAvailable = true;
            borrowedBy = null;
        }
    }
    
    public int getBookId() {
        return bookId;
    }
    
    public boolean isAvailable() {
        return isAvailable;
    }
}

// LibraryService interface
public interface LibraryService {
    void addBook(Book book);
    void checkoutBook(int bookId, int userId);
    void returnBook(int bookId);
    void addUser(User user);
}

// Library class
public class Library implements LibraryService {
    private ConcurrentHashMap<Integer, Book> books;
    private ConcurrentHashMap<Integer, User> users;
    private ReentrantLock lock;
    
    public Library() {
        this.books = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
        this.users = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
        this.lock = new ReentrantLock();
    }
    
    @Override
    public void addBook(Book book) {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            books.put(book.getBookId(), book);
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }
    
    @Override
    public void checkoutBook(int bookId, int userId) {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            Book book = books.get(bookId);
            User user = users.get(userId);
            if (book == null || user == null) {
                throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid book or user ID");
            }
            book.checkout(user);
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }
    
    @Override
    public void returnBook(int bookId) {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            Book book = books.get(bookId);
            if (book == null) {
                throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid book ID");
            }
            book.returnBook();
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }
    
    @Override
    public void addUser(User user) {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            users.put(user.getUserId(), user);
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }
    
    // Example usage with concurrency
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Library library = new Library();
        library.addBook(new Book(1, "Java Design Patterns"));
        library.addUser(new User(101, "Alice"));
        
        // Simulate concurrent checkout
        Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> library.checkoutBook(1, 101));
        Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> library.checkoutBook(1, 101));
        
        t1.start();
        t2.start();
        
        try {
            t1.join();
            t2.join();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        
        library.returnBook(1);
        System.out.println("Book 1 available: " + library.books.get(1).isAvailable());
        // Output: Book 1 available: true
    }
}
```
- **OOP and Concurrency Principles**:
  - **Encapsulation**: Private fields (`bookId`, `isAvailable`) with getters.
  - **Polymorphism**: `LibraryService` interface supports extensibility.
  - **Abstraction**: Hides concurrency and data management details.
  - **Thread Safety**: Uses `ReentrantLock` and `ConcurrentHashMap` (Lecture 4).
  - **Clean Code**: Meaningful names, modularity (Section 9).
  - **Refactoring**: Modular design avoids God Class (Lecture 7).
- **Big O**: O(1) for `addBook`, `checkoutBook`, `returnBook`, `addUser` with `ConcurrentHashMap`.
- **Edge Cases**: Handles invalid IDs, concurrent checkouts, unavailable books.

**Systematic Approach**:
- Clarified requirements (add/checkout/return books, thread-safe).
- Designed UML diagram to model `Library`, `Book`, `User`, `LibraryService`.
- Implemented Java classes with OOP, concurrency, and clean code.
- Discussed trade-offs (e.g., `ConcurrentHashMap` for performance vs. `List` for simplicity).
- Tested with `main` method for concurrent operations.

## Real-World Application
Imagine designing a library management system for a community library, where multiple users check out books simultaneously. Using OOP, UML, and concurrency ensures thread-safe operations, scalability for new features (e.g., reservations), and clear communication with stakeholders. This approach—synthesizing OOD principles—prepares you for interviews and demonstrates your ability to mentor teams on robust design.

## Practice Exercises
Apply OOD in mock interviews with these exercises:
- **Easy**: Design a UML diagram and Java code for a `VendingMachine` system with `Item` and `Transaction` classes.
- **Medium**: Create a UML diagram and thread-safe Java code for a `CarRental` system with `Car` and `Customer` classes.
- **Medium**: Implement a `RestaurantReservation` system with `Table` and `Booking` classes, ensuring concurrency.
- **Hard**: Design a thread-safe `OnlineStore` system with `Product`, `Order`, and `Payment` classes, including UML.

Try designing one system in Java with a UML diagram in a 45-minute mock interview, explaining your process aloud.

## Conclusion
Mastering OOD interviews equips you to design modular, thread-safe Java systems under pressure. By synthesizing OOP, UML, concurrency, and refactoring, you’ll excel in interviews, build robust software, and teach others effectively. This completes Section 2, setting you up for success in the *Official CTO* journey.
