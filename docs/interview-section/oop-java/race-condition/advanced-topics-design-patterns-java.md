## 🧮 1. Lock-Free Algorithms and Compare-And-Swap (CAS)

### The Need for Lock-Free Designs

Traditional synchronization (`synchronized`, `ReentrantLock`) ensures mutual exclusion but comes at a cost:

- Context switching overhead
- Potential deadlocks
- Reduced scalability under contention

Lock-free algorithms, in contrast, rely on **atomic hardware operations** to achieve thread safety **without blocking**.

### What Is Compare-And-Swap (CAS)?

At the heart of lock-free programming lies the **Compare-And-Swap** instruction — a CPU-level atomic primitive. It compares a variable’s current value to an expected value and, if they match, replaces it with a new value.

```java
boolean compareAndSwapInt(Object obj, long offset, int expect, int update);
```

Conceptually:

```
if (value == expected) {
    value = update;
    return true;
} else {
    return false;
}
```

This operation happens atomically — no other thread can interleave between the comparison and the update.

### Java’s CAS Support

Java exposes CAS via the **`sun.misc.Unsafe`** API and higher-level classes like `AtomicInteger`, `AtomicReference`, and `AtomicStampedReference`.

#### Example: Using CAS with AtomicInteger

```java
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;

class CasCounter {
    private final AtomicInteger count = new AtomicInteger(0);

    public void increment() {
        while (true) {
            int existing = count.get();
            int newValue = existing + 1;
            if (count.compareAndSet(existing, newValue)) {
                return;
            }
        }
    }

    public int get() {
        return count.get();
    }
}
```

This loop repeatedly tries to update `count` until it succeeds — a **spin loop**. If another thread updates the value first, `compareAndSet()` fails and retries.

### Benefits of Lock-Free Programming

- **No blocking** — threads don’t wait for locks.
- **High scalability** — ideal for low-contention counters, queues, and pools.
- **Deadlock-free** — CAS avoids mutual exclusion.

### Pitfalls

- **CPU spinning** may waste cycles under high contention.
- **ABA problem**: a variable changes from A → B → A, fooling CAS into thinking it’s unchanged.  
  Use `AtomicStampedReference` or `AtomicMarkableReference` to track versions.

#### Example: Avoiding ABA

```java
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicStampedReference;

class SafeReference<T> {
    private final AtomicStampedReference<T> ref = new AtomicStampedReference<>(null, 0);

    public boolean update(T expected, T newValue) {
        int stamp = ref.getStamp();
        return ref.compareAndSet(expected, newValue, stamp, stamp + 1);
    }
}
```

CAS operations form the foundation of **lock-free data structures**, such as **ConcurrentLinkedQueue** and **ConcurrentHashMap**.

## 🧩 2. Designing Thread-Safe Classes

Designing for concurrency means building components that can be **safely used by multiple threads**. Let’s explore several strategies and design patterns that ensure thread safety.

### Strategy 1: Immutability

Immutable objects cannot be modified after construction — hence automatically thread-safe.

```java
final class User {
    private final String name;
    private final int age;

    public User(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    public String getName() { return name; }
    public int getAge() { return age; }
}
```

- No synchronization needed.
- Safe to publish and share across threads.
- Use builder patterns for complex immutables.

### Strategy 2: Thread Confinement

Restrict an object to be used only within one thread — e.g., local variables, thread-local storage.

```java
ThreadLocal<SimpleDateFormat> formatter =
    ThreadLocal.withInitial(() -> new SimpleDateFormat("yyyy-MM-dd"));
```

Each thread gets its own formatter — solving `SimpleDateFormat`’s thread-safety issue.

### Strategy 3: Confinement via Stack and Message Passing

Avoid sharing at all. Instead of multiple threads updating shared state, communicate through **queues**.

```java
BlockingQueue<Task> queue = new LinkedBlockingQueue<>();

new Thread(() -> {
    while (true) process(queue.take());
}).start();
```

This follows the **actor model** pattern — confinement through message passing.

### Strategy 4: Using Thread-Safe Collections

Use Java’s `java.util.concurrent` structures instead of manual locking:

- `ConcurrentHashMap`
- `CopyOnWriteArrayList`
- `ConcurrentLinkedQueue`

They internally use **fine-grained locks** or **lock-free algorithms** for high concurrency.

### Strategy 5: Synchronization at the Right Level

Use synchronization to protect **invariants**, not every field.

Bad example:

```java
public synchronized void setX(int x) { this.x = x; }
public synchronized void setY(int y) { this.y = y; }
```

Good example:

```java
public synchronized void move(int newX, int newY) {
    x = newX;
    y = newY;
}
```

Here, both fields are updated together, preserving invariants.

## ⚙️ 3. Concurrency Utilities in Depth

The `java.util.concurrent` package provides powerful **utilities** for synchronization, coordination, and task management. These utilities make high-level concurrency much easier and safer.

### CountDownLatch

A **CountDownLatch** allows one or more threads to wait until a set of operations completes.

#### Example: Waiting for Multiple Services

```java
import java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch;

class AppStartup {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(3);

        Thread db = new Thread(() -> { init("Database"); latch.countDown(); });
        Thread cache = new Thread(() -> { init("Cache"); latch.countDown(); });
        Thread api = new Thread(() -> { init("API"); latch.countDown(); });

        db.start(); cache.start(); api.start();

        latch.await(); // Wait for all to complete
        System.out.println("All services ready!");
    }

    private static void init(String name) {
        System.out.println("Initializing " + name);
        try { Thread.sleep(1000); } catch (InterruptedException ignored) {}
    }
}
```

### CyclicBarrier

A **CyclicBarrier** lets multiple threads wait at a common barrier point before continuing — often used in parallel computations.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.CyclicBarrier;

class ParallelWorker {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CyclicBarrier barrier = new CyclicBarrier(3, () ->
            System.out.println("All threads reached barrier, proceeding..."));

        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            new Thread(() -> {
                try {
                    System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " working...");
                    Thread.sleep(500);
                    barrier.await();
                } catch (Exception ignored) {}
            }).start();
        }
    }
}
```

### ExecutorService

Instead of manually creating threads, Java provides the **Executor framework**, which separates **task submission** from **task execution**.

#### Example: Fixed Thread Pool

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class ThreadPoolDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);

        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            int taskId = i;
            executor.submit(() -> {
                System.out.println("Task " + taskId + " by " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
            });
        }

        executor.shutdown();
        executor.awaitTermination(1, TimeUnit.MINUTES);
    }
}
```

- **`Executors.newCachedThreadPool()`** — creates threads dynamically.
- **`newScheduledThreadPool()`** — for delayed or periodic tasks.
- **`newSingleThreadExecutor()`** — executes sequentially.

## 🔬 4. Testing and Detecting Race Conditions

Concurrency bugs are hard to reproduce because they depend on timing. Systematic testing requires **tools**, **strategies**, and **assertions** that expose timing-sensitive issues.

### 4.1. Stress Testing

Run concurrent operations repeatedly with random timing to expose issues.

```java
ExecutorService pool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10);
for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
    pool.submit(() -> sharedResource.update());
}
pool.shutdown();
pool.awaitTermination(1, TimeUnit.MINUTES);
```

### 4.2. Thread Sleep Injection

Artificially insert sleeps or delays in suspicious code regions to force interleavings:

```java
if (Math.random() < 0.1) Thread.sleep(1);
```

This can expose races that otherwise occur rarely.

### 4.3. Use Concurrency Testing Tools

- **Thread Sanitizer (TSan)** — detects data races at runtime.
- **Java Concurrency Stress (jcstress)** — a JVM testing harness for concurrency correctness.
- **FindBugs/SpotBugs concurrency detector** — static analysis.

### 4.4. Code Reviews and Static Analysis

- Review shared state carefully.
- Check for non-atomic compound operations.
- Identify misuse of `volatile`.

### 4.5. Logging and Monitoring

In production, capture concurrency metrics (e.g., queue sizes, thread states) using tools like **VisualVM**, **JConsole**, and **Flight Recorder**.

## 🏗️ 5. Real-World Examples and Design Patterns

Let’s see how concurrency appears in everyday system design.

### Example 1: Thread-Safe Session Manager

```java
import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap;

class SessionManager {
    private final ConcurrentHashMap<String, String> sessions = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();

    public void createSession(String userId) {
        sessions.put(userId, generateToken());
    }

    public String getSession(String userId) {
        return sessions.get(userId);
    }

    public void removeSession(String userId) {
        sessions.remove(userId);
    }

    private String generateToken() {
        return java.util.UUID.randomUUID().toString();
    }
}
```

- Uses **ConcurrentHashMap** for thread-safe access.
- Avoids explicit synchronization.

### Example 2: Lock-Free Counter

```java
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.LongAdder;

class RequestCounter {
    private final LongAdder counter = new LongAdder();

    public void increment() { counter.increment(); }
    public long getTotal() { return counter.sum(); }
}
```

`LongAdder` scales better than `AtomicInteger` under contention — it maintains multiple counters internally and aggregates them on demand.

### Example 3: Producer-Consumer Queue

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

class ProducerConsumer {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BlockingQueue<String> queue = new LinkedBlockingQueue<>();

        Thread producer = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                try {
                    queue.put("Task-" + i);
                    System.out.println("Produced: Task-" + i);
                } catch (InterruptedException e) { Thread.currentThread().interrupt(); }
            }
        });

        Thread consumer = new Thread(() -> {
            try {
                while (true) {
                    String task = queue.take();
                    System.out.println("Consumed: " + task);
                }
            } catch (InterruptedException e) { Thread.currentThread().interrupt(); }
        });

        producer.start();
        consumer.start();
    }
}
```

- Uses a blocking queue for synchronization.
- No need for explicit locks.

## 💬 7. Interview Questions & How to Answer Them

### Q1. What’s the difference between `synchronized` and `ReentrantLock`?

**Answer:**
- Both provide mutual exclusion.
- `ReentrantLock` gives extra control: fairness, `tryLock()`, and interruptibility.
- Use `synchronized` when simple, `ReentrantLock` when flexibility is needed.

### Q2. Explain the difference between `volatile` and `AtomicInteger`.

**Answer:**
- `volatile` guarantees visibility, not atomicity.
- `AtomicInteger` guarantees both visibility and atomic updates via CAS.
- Prefer `AtomicInteger` for counters or accumulators.

### Q3. What is the ABA problem in CAS?

**Answer:**
The ABA problem occurs when a variable changes from A → B → A, and a CAS operation mistakenly assumes it hasn’t changed.  
**Solution:** Use `AtomicStampedReference` to include a version stamp.

### Q4. Difference between `CountDownLatch` and `CyclicBarrier`?

**Answer:**
- `CountDownLatch` is one-time use; used to wait for other threads to finish.
- `CyclicBarrier` is reusable; used to synchronize threads at a common point.

### Q5. How do you test for race conditions?

**Answer:**
- Use stress tests with many threads.
- Insert artificial delays.
- Use tools like jcstress or thread sanitizer.

### Q6. What’s the difference between `ExecutorService` and `ForkJoinPool`?

**Answer:**
- `ExecutorService` manages independent tasks.
- `ForkJoinPool` optimizes for tasks that can be split recursively (work-stealing).

### Q7. Explain “happens-before” in simple terms.

**Answer:**
If one action **happens-before** another, the first’s results are guaranteed visible to the second.  
Synchronization, volatile, and thread start/join establish happens-before edges.
