# Preventing Race Conditions in Java (Practical Mitigation Techniques)

This part focuses on practical concurrency control mechanisms, including:

- `synchronized` and `ReentrantLock`
- The `volatile` keyword
- Atomic variables and concurrent data structures
- Happens-before guarantees revisited
- A detailed best practices checklist

By the end, you‚Äôll have a concrete toolkit for writing **race-free concurrent Java code**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è 1. Synchronization ‚Äî The Core Defense

The most direct way to **prevent race conditions** is by using **synchronization** ‚Äî controlling access to shared resources so that **only one thread** can execute a critical section at a time.

### The `synchronized` Keyword

In Java, `synchronized` provides **mutual exclusion** and **visibility guarantees**. When a thread enters a `synchronized` block or method, it acquires a **monitor lock**; when it exits, it releases that lock.

All variables written inside the synchronized block become **visible** to any thread that subsequently acquires the same lock ‚Äî establishing a **happens-before relationship**.

#### Example: Preventing Race in Counter

```java
class Counter {
    private int count = 0;

    public synchronized void increment() {
        count++;
    }

    public synchronized int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}
```

Now, only one thread can execute `increment()` at a time. Each write to `count` is visible to all subsequent threads that enter a synchronized block on the same object.

#### Internal Mechanics

Each Java object has an **intrinsic lock (monitor)**. When a synchronized block is entered, the JVM:

1. Acquires the monitor of the specified object.
2. Ensures visibility of all prior writes.
3. Executes the critical section.
4. Releases the lock (flushing changes to main memory).

### Synchronized Block Example

```java
class BankAccount {
    private int balance = 100;

    public void deposit(int amount) {
        synchronized (this) {
            balance += amount;
        }
    }

    public void withdraw(int amount) {
        synchronized (this) {
            balance -= amount;
        }
    }
}
```

Both methods synchronize on the same lock (`this`), ensuring **mutual exclusion**. Without synchronization, simultaneous deposits and withdrawals could lead to inconsistent balances.

### Static Synchronization

Static synchronized methods lock on the **class object** rather than an instance.

```java
class Logger {
    public static synchronized void log(String msg) {
        System.out.println(msg);
    }
}
```

Only one thread can call any static synchronized method of the class at a time.

## üîí 2. Advanced Control with `ReentrantLock`

While `synchronized` is simple and safe, Java provides a more flexible mechanism: **`ReentrantLock`** (from `java.util.concurrent.locks`).

### Why Use ReentrantLock?

- It supports **fairness** (FIFO thread access).
- You can **try** acquiring the lock without blocking indefinitely.
- You can **interrupt** threads waiting for the lock.
- It offers better **diagnostic control** (e.g., `isHeldByCurrentThread()`).

### Example: Using `ReentrantLock`

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

class SafeCounter {
    private final ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();
    private int count = 0;

    public void increment() {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            count++;
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }

    public int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}
```

The `lock()` and `unlock()` calls wrap the critical section. Using a `finally` block ensures the lock is always released ‚Äî even if exceptions occur.

### Fair Locks

```java
ReentrantLock fairLock = new ReentrantLock(true); // Fair mode
```

Fair locks ensure threads acquire locks in the order they requested them. This can reduce throughput but improves predictability in high-contention environments.

### tryLock()

Unlike `synchronized`, `ReentrantLock` allows **non-blocking attempts**:

```java
if (lock.tryLock()) {
    try {
        // critical section
    } finally {
        lock.unlock();
    }
} else {
    // Could not acquire lock ‚Äî handle gracefully
}
```

### Interruptible Locks

```java
try {
    lock.lockInterruptibly();
    // do work
} catch (InterruptedException e) {
    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
}
```

This allows a thread to stop waiting for a lock when interrupted ‚Äî useful for responsive applications.

## ‚ö° 3. The `volatile` Keyword Explained

While locks ensure both **mutual exclusion** and **visibility**, sometimes you only need **visibility** ‚Äî ensuring that updates made by one thread are seen by others, without necessarily locking.

That‚Äôs where the **`volatile` keyword** comes in.

### What `volatile` Does

Declaring a variable `volatile` tells the JVM:

1. Writes to the variable are **immediately visible** to all threads.
2. Reads always fetch the **most recent value** from main memory.
3. Prevents **reordering** of reads/writes around it.

However, it **does not guarantee atomicity** for compound actions (like increment).

### Example: Visibility Without Volatile

```java
class FlagExample {
    private boolean flag = false;

    public void writer() {
        flag = true;
    }

    public void reader() {
        while (!flag) {
            // may never exit!
        }
    }
}
```

Without `volatile`, the reader thread might **cache** the value of `flag` in a register, never seeing the update from another thread.

### Example: Fix with Volatile

```java
class FlagExample {
    private volatile boolean flag = false;

    public void writer() {
        flag = true;
    }

    public void reader() {
        while (!flag) {
            // now guaranteed to see latest value
        }
    }
}
```

Now, changes to `flag` are **immediately visible** across threads.


### Volatile Does *Not* Make Compound Operations Atomic

```java
class Counter {
    private volatile int count = 0;

    public void increment() {
        count++; // still NOT atomic!
    }
}
```

Even though `count` is volatile, `count++` performs a read-modify-write, which can still interleave between threads.

**Fix:** Use `AtomicInteger` or synchronization.


### Happens-Before Guarantee of Volatile

A **write** to a volatile variable **happens-before** every **subsequent read** of that variable by any thread.

This ensures visibility but not mutual exclusion.

## üî¢ 4. Atomic Variables and Concurrent Data Structures

Java provides lock-free thread safety through **atomic variables** in `java.util.concurrent.atomic`. These classes rely on **hardware-level Compare-And-Swap (CAS)** operations to perform updates atomically without using locks.

### Common Atomic Classes

| Class | Type | Use Case |
|--------|------|-----------|
| `AtomicInteger` | int | Counters, indexes |
| `AtomicLong` | long | High-precision counters |
| `AtomicBoolean` | boolean | Shared flags |
| `AtomicReference<T>` | reference | Managing shared objects safely |

### Example: Atomic Counter

```java
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;

class AtomicCounter {
    private final AtomicInteger count = new AtomicInteger(0);

    public void increment() {
        count.incrementAndGet(); // Atomic operation
    }

    public int getCount() {
        return count.get();
    }
}
```

This approach is **lock-free** and **non-blocking**. Each increment uses CAS ‚Äî retrying internally until successful.

### Compare: AtomicInteger vs Synchronized

| Feature | `AtomicInteger` | `synchronized` |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| Mutual exclusion | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Lock overhead | ‚ùå None | ‚úÖ Context switch possible |
| Visibility | ‚úÖ Guaranteed | ‚úÖ Guaranteed |
| Performance (low contention) | üöÄ Fast | ‚öôÔ∏è Slower |
| Performance (high contention) | ‚öñÔ∏è Moderate | ‚öñÔ∏è Similar |
| Reentrancy | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes |

#### When to Use

- Use **`AtomicInteger`** for independent variables where only atomic updates are needed.
- Use **`synchronized`/`ReentrantLock`** when operations involve **multiple shared variables** or complex invariants.

### Example: AtomicReference for Safe Object Swaps

```java
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicReference;

class ConfigManager {
    private final AtomicReference<String> config = new AtomicReference<>("default");

    public void update(String newConfig) {
        config.set(newConfig);
    }

    public String getConfig() {
        return config.get();
    }
}
```

Atomic references are great for maintaining shared objects safely without locks.


### Concurrent Collections

Java‚Äôs `java.util.concurrent` package includes data structures that handle synchronization internally:

| Class | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| `ConcurrentHashMap` | Thread-safe, high-performance map with segmented locks. |
| `CopyOnWriteArrayList` | Ideal for mostly-read scenarios. Writes create new copies. |
| `ConcurrentLinkedQueue` | Non-blocking FIFO queue. |
| `BlockingQueue` | Supports producer-consumer pattern. |
| `ConcurrentSkipListMap` | Sorted concurrent map (lock-free). |

#### Example: Using ConcurrentHashMap

```java
import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap;

class ConcurrentCache {
    private final ConcurrentHashMap<String, Integer> cache = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();

    public void put(String key, int value) {
        cache.put(key, value);
    }

    public Integer get(String key) {
        return cache.get(key);
    }
}
```

Concurrent collections eliminate the need for manual synchronization for most common operations.

## üß© 5. Happens-Before Guarantees (Revisited)

Let‚Äôs reinforce the **happens-before** guarantees that Java provides ‚Äî these relationships form the backbone of race condition prevention.

| Relationship | Guarantee |
|---------------|------------|
| **Program Order** | Each action in a thread happens-before later actions in the same thread. |
| **Monitor Lock** | Unlock on a monitor happens-before every subsequent lock on the same monitor. |
| **Volatile Variable** | Write to a volatile field happens-before every subsequent read of that field. |
| **Thread Start** | `Thread.start()` happens-before any action in the started thread. |
| **Thread Join** | Any action in a thread happens-before another thread‚Äôs successful `join()` on it. |
| **Final Field Rule** | Writes to final fields in a constructor happen-before any subsequent read of the object reference. |

Proper synchronization ensures these relationships hold, guaranteeing visibility and ordering.

## ‚úÖ 6. Best Practices Checklist

Let‚Äôs summarize actionable best practices to **prevent race conditions** effectively in Java.

### ‚úÖ General Principles

- **Avoid shared mutable state** whenever possible.
- **Prefer immutability** ‚Äî immutable objects are naturally thread-safe.
- **Keep critical sections small** ‚Äî synchronize only what‚Äôs necessary.
- **Never block inside synchronized blocks** (e.g., avoid I/O).
- **Use concurrent collections** instead of manually synchronized structures.

### ‚úÖ Using Locks

- Always **release locks in `finally` blocks**.
- Avoid **nested locks** (can cause deadlocks).
- Use **`tryLock()`** to avoid indefinite blocking.
- Prefer **`ReentrantLock`** only when advanced features are needed.

### ‚úÖ Volatile Usage

- Use `volatile` for **simple flags or state signals**.
- Don‚Äôt use `volatile` for compound actions (like increment).
- Remember: `volatile` guarantees **visibility**, not **atomicity**.

### ‚úÖ Atomic Variables

- Use `AtomicInteger`, `AtomicLong`, or `AtomicReference` for **lock-free updates**.
- Choose atomic classes when you only need atomicity for a **single variable**.

### ‚úÖ Thread Safety Patterns

- **Thread confinement**: Restrict objects to one thread.
- **Immutable objects**: Prefer final fields, no setters.
- **Safe publication**: Use volatile, final, or proper synchronization to publish objects safely.

### ‚úÖ Testing & Debugging

- Use **Thread Sanitizers** and tools like `jstack`, `VisualVM`, or `IntelliJ Concurrency Visualizer`.
- Introduce **artificial delays** in tests to expose timing-related bugs.
- Use **ExecutorService** instead of manually managing threads.

## üîç Example: Combining Techniques

Here‚Äôs a real-world example combining multiple techniques:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;

class TaskQueue {
    private final AtomicInteger processedCount = new AtomicInteger(0);
    private final BlockingQueue<String> queue = new LinkedBlockingQueue<>();
    private volatile boolean running = true;

    public void submit(String task) {
        queue.offer(task);
    }

    public void process() {
        while (running || !queue.isEmpty()) {
            try {
                String task = queue.poll(100, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
                if (task != null) {
                    System.out.println("Processing: " + task);
                    processedCount.incrementAndGet();
                }
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            }
        }
    }

    public void stop() {
        running = false;
    }

    public int getProcessedCount() {
        return processedCount.get();
    }
}

public class TaskProcessorDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        TaskQueue taskQueue = new TaskQueue();

        Thread producer = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
                taskQueue.submit("Task-" + i);
            }
            taskQueue.stop();
        });

        Thread consumer = new Thread(taskQueue::process);

        producer.start();
        consumer.start();

        producer.join();
        consumer.join();

        System.out.println("Total processed: " + taskQueue.getProcessedCount());
    }
}
```

This design avoids race conditions using:
- `BlockingQueue` for safe inter-thread communication
- `AtomicInteger` for atomic counting
- `volatile` flag for visibility
