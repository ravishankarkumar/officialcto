# Executor Framework in Java (Expanded)

The **Executor Framework** (in `java.util.concurrent`) is the recommended, high-level API for managing threads and asynchronous tasks in Java. It decouples task submission from thread creation and lifecycle, providing thread pools, scheduling, and utilities for parallelism.

## Why use Executor Framework?
- **Thread pooling**: Reuse threads instead of creating new ones for every task — reduces overhead and improves performance.
- **Lifecycle management**: Centralized control over when threads start, stop, and how many are used.
- **Task queuing**: Submit many tasks; the executor queues and schedules them using worker threads.
- **Separation of concerns**: Submit `Runnable`/`Callable` tasks without managing threads directly.
- **Better resource control**: Limit concurrency to avoid resource exhaustion (e.g., CPU, memory, sockets).
- **Built-in utilities**: Scheduling, completion services, fork/join parallelism.

## Basic Usage
```java
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);
executor.submit(() -> System.out.println("Task executed"));
executor.shutdown();
```

### Submitting tasks
- `submit(Runnable)` returns a `Future<?>`.
- `submit(Callable<T>)` returns a `Future<T>` useful for results/exceptions.
- `execute(Runnable)` (from `Executor`) returns void and is for fire-and-forget tasks.

## Types of Thread Pools and When to Use Them

### 1. `newFixedThreadPool(n)`
- **Behavior**: Creates a pool with *n* threads. Excess tasks are queued (unbounded queue by default).
- **Use when**: You want a stable number of threads (e.g., fixed worker pool processing tasks).
- **Tradeoffs**: Predictable concurrency, but if tasks block, threads may be all occupied causing queue growth.

Example:
```java
ExecutorService fixedPool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10);
```

### 2. `newCachedThreadPool()`
- **Behavior**: Creates new threads as needed, reuses idle threads; threads that remain idle for 60s are terminated.
- **Use when**: Many short-lived asynchronous tasks; throughput-focused use cases.
- **Tradeoffs**: Good for bursty loads, but unbounded thread creation can exhaust resources under sustained high load.

Example:
```java
ExecutorService cached = Executors.newCachedThreadPool();
```

### 3. `newSingleThreadExecutor()`
- **Behavior**: Single worker thread; tasks executed sequentially.
- **Use when**: You need order and single-threaded access to a resource.
- **Tradeoffs**: Simplicity but no parallelism.

Example:
```java
ExecutorService single = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
```

### 4. `newScheduledThreadPool(n)`
- **Behavior**: Supports delayed and periodic task execution (`schedule`, `scheduleAtFixedRate`, `scheduleWithFixedDelay`).
- **Use when**: Scheduling background jobs, heartbeats, or retries.
- **Tradeoffs**: Be careful with long-running scheduled tasks which can starve other scheduled work if pool size is small.

Example:
```java
ScheduledExecutorService scheduler = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(2);
scheduler.scheduleAtFixedRate(() -> poll(), 0, 1, TimeUnit.MINUTES);
```

### 5. `ForkJoinPool` (and `ForkJoinPool.commonPool()`)
- **Behavior**: Designed for divide-and-conquer parallelism using `ForkJoinTask` / `RecursiveTask` / `RecursiveAction`. Uses work-stealing algorithm.
- **Use when**: CPU-bound parallel tasks that can be recursively split (e.g., parallel streams, parallel sorts).
- **Tradeoffs**: Excellent for fine-grained parallelism; misused for blocking I/O tasks can harm throughput. Parallel streams use the common `ForkJoinPool` by default.

Example:
```java
ForkJoinPool fjp = new ForkJoinPool(Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors());
fjp.invoke(new MyRecursiveTask(...));
```

## ThreadPoolExecutor: Advanced Configuration
`ThreadPoolExecutor` (the implementation behind many factory methods) allows customizing:
- `corePoolSize` and `maximumPoolSize`
- `keepAliveTime` for non-core threads
- `BlockingQueue<Runnable>` (e.g., `LinkedBlockingQueue`, `ArrayBlockingQueue`, `SynchronousQueue`)
- `RejectedExecutionHandler` policies:
  - `AbortPolicy` (throws `RejectedExecutionException`)
  - `CallerRunsPolicy` (caller runs the task, providing backpressure)
  - `DiscardPolicy` (silently discards task)
  - `DiscardOldestPolicy` (drops oldest queued task)

Example:
```java
ThreadPoolExecutor executor = new ThreadPoolExecutor(
    10, // core
    50, // max
    60L, TimeUnit.SECONDS,
    new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(100),
    new ThreadPoolExecutor.CallerRunsPolicy()
);
```

### Choosing the Queue
- **Unbounded queue** (`LinkedBlockingQueue` with no capacity): `maximumPoolSize` ignored; risk of OOM if producers outpace consumers.
- **Bounded queue** (`ArrayBlockingQueue`): Provides backpressure; combined with `RejectedExecutionHandler` shapes behavior.
- **SynchronousQueue**: Hands off tasks directly to threads; works well with cached thread pool semantics.

## Rejection Policies and Backpressure
Under sustained load, tasks may be rejected. Choose a policy based on desired behavior:
- Use `CallerRunsPolicy` to slow down submitters.
- Use bounded queues to apply backpressure early and avoid OOM.
- Reject fast for systems where dropping tasks is acceptable (e.g., metrics).

## Shutdown and Termination
- `shutdown()`: Stops accepting new tasks; waits for queued tasks to finish.
- `shutdownNow()`: Attempts to cancel running tasks and returns queued tasks.
- `awaitTermination(timeout, unit)`: Blocks until termination or timeout.

Best practice:
```java
executor.shutdown();
if (!executor.awaitTermination(60, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) {
    executor.shutdownNow();
}
```

## Exception Handling
- Exceptions thrown by `Runnable` tasks are logged but not propagated; use `Future` to catch exceptions from `Callable`.
- Use `ThreadFactory` to set an `UncaughtExceptionHandler` for threads.
- Wrap tasks to capture/log exceptions:
```java
executor.submit(() -> {
    try {
        riskyOperation();
    } catch (Throwable t) {
        log.error("Task failed", t);
        throw t;
    }
});
```

## Monitoring and Metrics
Monitor:
- Active thread count (`ThreadPoolExecutor.getActiveCount()`)
- Queue size (`getQueue().size()`)
- Task completed count (`getCompletedTaskCount()`)
- Rejected task count via custom `RejectedExecutionHandler`

Expose these as metrics (Prometheus, CloudWatch) to decide autoscaling or tuning.

## Best Practices
1. **Prefer Executors over raw threads** — easier to manage and reason about.
2. **Avoid blocking calls in ForkJoinPool** — use dedicated pools for blocking I/O.
3. **Use bounded queues** with appropriate size to apply backpressure.
4. **Choose sensible pool sizes** — for CPU-bound tasks: `N = #cores * (1 + waitTime/computeTime)` (approximation). For I/O-bound tasks, allow more threads.
5. **Use Named ThreadFactory** to aid debugging and monitoring.
6. **Shutdown executors gracefully** on application exit.
7. **Handle task exceptions** and instrument failures.
8. **Use CompletableFuture and higher-level constructs** for composition and async flows.

## Common Patterns
- **Producer–Consumer**: submit tasks to a bounded queue processed by worker threads.
- **CompletionService**: `ExecutorCompletionService` helps process `Callable` results as they complete.
- **Async with CompletableFuture**: `CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> ..., executor)` for composing async operations.

## Example: ThreadPool tuned for I/O-bound tasks
```java
int cores = Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors();
int poolSize = cores * 2; // heuristic for I/O-bound workload
ThreadPoolExecutor ioPool = new ThreadPoolExecutor(
    poolSize, poolSize,
    0L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS,
    new LinkedBlockingQueue<>(500),
    Executors.defaultThreadFactory(),
    new ThreadPoolExecutor.CallerRunsPolicy()
);
```

## When Executors are not enough
- For massive scale or heterogeneous workloads, combine multiple executors specialized for CPU vs I/O tasks.
- Use reactive frameworks (Project Reactor, RxJava) for backpressure-aware async pipelines.

# Summary
The Executor Framework provides the building blocks for robust concurrency in Java: thread pools, scheduling, and advanced tuning via `ThreadPoolExecutor`. Understanding pool types, queues, rejection policies, and best practices is essential for writing scalable, resilient Java services.
