# Java Concurrency – Interview & Real-World Scenarios

This final part in our Java Concurrency series focuses on **interview-specific pitfalls** and **real-world concurrency scenarios**. You’ll learn how to avoid traps like deadlocks, design producer–consumer pipelines, and compare concurrency models.

## 1. Common Interview Pitfalls

### Singleton and Concurrency
A common interview question: *“How do you make a Singleton thread-safe in Java?”*

- **Incorrect (not thread-safe):**
```java
public class BadSingleton {
    private static BadSingleton instance;
    public static BadSingleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new BadSingleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

- **Thread-safe (synchronized method):**
```java
public class SafeSingleton {
    private static SafeSingleton instance;
    public static synchronized SafeSingleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new SafeSingleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

- **Better (double-checked locking with volatile):**
```java
public class DCLSingleton {
    private static volatile DCLSingleton instance;
    public static DCLSingleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            synchronized (DCLSingleton.class) {
                if (instance == null) {
                    instance = new DCLSingleton();
                }
            }
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

### Deadlock Avoidance
- **Scenario**: Two threads hold locks in opposite order.
- **Fix**: Always acquire locks in a consistent global order or use `tryLock()` with timeout.

### Other Interview Traps
- Misusing `volatile` to guarantee atomicity (it doesn’t).
- Assuming `HashMap` is thread-safe (it’s not).
- Forgetting to shut down an `ExecutorService`.

---

## 2. Designing a Producer–Consumer Pipeline

A classic concurrency problem, common in interviews and real systems.

### Example with `BlockingQueue`
```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

class ProducerConsumer {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BlockingQueue<Integer> queue = new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(5);

        Runnable producer = () -> {
            try {
                for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
                    queue.put(i);
                    System.out.println("Produced " + i);
                }
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            }
        };

        Runnable consumer = () -> {
            try {
                while (true) {
                    int item = queue.take();
                    System.out.println("Consumed " + item);
                }
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            }
        };

        new Thread(producer).start();
        new Thread(consumer).start();
    }
}
```

- **Why BlockingQueue?**
  - Handles synchronization internally.
  - Blocks producers if full, consumers if empty.
  - Avoids manual `wait()`/`notify()` pitfalls.

## 3. Comparing Concurrency Models

### Threads (Low-Level Model)
- Explicitly create and manage threads.
- Full control but more error-prone.
- Good for **fine-grained concurrency**, but harder to scale.

### Async/Callback Model
- Uses event loops and futures.
- Example: `CompletableFuture` in Java.
```java
CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> "data")
    .thenApply(String::toUpperCase)
    .thenAccept(System.out::println);
```
- Great for **I/O-bound tasks**.
- Drawback: Callback hell if not structured well.

### Actor Model
- Each actor encapsulates state and communicates via messages.
- Popularized by **Akka** (Java/Scala).
- Scales horizontally across cores/nodes.
- Great for **highly concurrent, distributed systems**.
- Tradeoff: Learning curve, debugging message-passing.

---

## 4. Best Practices for Interviews & Real Systems
- Always discuss **tradeoffs** (e.g., `synchronized` vs `Lock`).
- Mention **scalability** and **fairness** in locks.
- For pipelines, suggest **backpressure** handling (bounded queues).
- Prefer **immutable objects** to reduce synchronization.
- Highlight **higher-level abstractions** (`ExecutorService`, `CompletableFuture`, `Streams`).

---

## 5. Quick Interview Checklist
- Explain **thread safety** in Singleton.
- Avoid deadlocks → consistent lock ordering.
- Know **BlockingQueue** producer–consumer.
- Compare **Thread vs Async vs Actor**.
- Show knowledge of **CompletableFuture** for async flows.

---

# Conclusion
Concurrency is not just about writing threads — it’s about **designing safe, scalable systems**. For interviews, focus on correctness, clarity, and tradeoffs. In real-world systems, use higher-level abstractions and proven concurrency models to reduce complexity.
