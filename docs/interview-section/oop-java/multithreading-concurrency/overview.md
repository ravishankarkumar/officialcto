# Java Multithreading & Concurrency — Overview

Concurrency is a core concept in Java and a **favorite interview topic**. It allows applications to execute multiple tasks simultaneously, improving performance, scalability, and responsiveness. However, it also introduces challenges like **race conditions, deadlocks, and thread safety**.  

This overview lays the foundation for mastering Java’s concurrency model, preparing you for both **interviews** and **real-world system design**.


## Introduction

- **Multithreading**: Running multiple threads (lightweight processes) within a single program.  
- **Concurrency**: Ability of a program to deal with multiple tasks at once (may or may not be parallel).  

Multithreading is one way to achieve concurrency, but concurrency can also come from **async I/O, event-driven models, or distributed systems**.
