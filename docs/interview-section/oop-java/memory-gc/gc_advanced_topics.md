# Advanced Garbage Collection Topics in Java

Beyond the basics of GC algorithms and JVM collectors, advanced concepts around **JIT optimizations, object finalization, and memory leak patterns** are crucial for writing high-performance and leak-free Java applications. These are less about the GC algorithm itself and more about **how the JVM and developer code interact with memory management**.

---

## 1. Escape Analysis & Stack Allocation

The Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler uses **escape analysis** to determine the lifetime and scope of objects.

- **Escape analysis:** Checks whether an object can be accessed outside of the method or thread where it was created.
  - If an object **does not escape** the method, the JVM may allocate it on the **stack** instead of the heap.
  - This reduces GC pressure since stack memory is automatically reclaimed when the method ends.

**Example:**
```java
public int sum() {
    Point p = new Point(1, 2); // If p doesn't escape, JIT may stack-allocate it.
    return p.x + p.y;
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Reduced heap allocations.
- Less frequent GC.
- Performance boost.

👉 **Interview Tip:** Be ready to explain that escape analysis is why micro-benchmarks sometimes misrepresent allocations—because the JVM optimizes them away.

## 2. Finalization vs Cleaner API

### Finalization
- Objects could override `finalize()` to perform cleanup before GC.
- **Problems:**
  - Unpredictable execution (depends on GC timing).
  - Can resurrect objects, causing leaks.
  - Deprecated in modern Java.

### Cleaner API (Java 9+)
- Replaces `finalize()` with a safer mechanism.
- Registers a cleanup action to run when an object becomes phantom-reachable.
- Example:
```java
Cleaner cleaner = Cleaner.create();
class Resource implements AutoCloseable {
    private static final Cleaner.Cleanable cleanable;
    static {
        cleaner.register(this, () -> releaseNativeResource());
    }
    @Override
    public void close() { cleanable.clean(); }
}
```

👉 Use **try-with-resources** + `AutoCloseable` whenever possible. Cleaner is for low-level cases.

## 3. Memory Leaks in Java

Even with GC, memory leaks are possible when references prevent objects from being collected.

### Common Causes

1. **Static references:**
   - Static collections (e.g., `static List`) holding onto objects for program lifetime.

2. **Inner classes:**
   - Non-static inner classes hold an implicit reference to the outer class.
   - Can prevent outer object from being GCed.

3. **ThreadLocal misuse:**
   - Values stored in `ThreadLocal` may persist for the lifetime of a thread.
   - Common in thread pools, where threads live indefinitely.

4. **Unbounded caches / listeners:**
   - Not removing listeners, or caches without eviction policies.

### Example Leak:
```java
class LeakyClass {
    private static List<Object> cache = new ArrayList<>();
    public void add(Object o) {
        cache.add(o); // Never released
    }
}
```

## 4. Interview Focus: Memory Leaks Despite GC

**Question:** *“How can memory leaks happen in Java if GC exists?”*

**Answer Outline:**
- GC reclaims only unreachable objects.
- If a live reference chain exists (static variables, long-lived collections, thread locals), objects remain reachable and won’t be collected.
- Thus, leaks in Java are about **unintentional object retention** rather than manual `free()` mistakes.
- Tools like JVisualVM or Eclipse MAT help detect retained references.

👉 Key phrase: *“GC cannot clean up objects that are still reachable, even if they are no longer needed logically.”*

---

## Summary

- **Escape analysis** enables stack allocation, reducing GC load.
- **Finalization** is deprecated; prefer **Cleaner API** or `AutoCloseable`.
- **Memory leaks** in Java arise from unintentional references (static fields, ThreadLocals, inner classes).
- For interviews, stress that GC doesn’t prevent leaks—it only reclaims unreachable memory.

👉 Advanced GC knowledge is valuable for performance tuning and debugging complex production issues.
