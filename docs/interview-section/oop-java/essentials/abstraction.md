# Abstraction: Modeling Relevant Details

## Introduction
**Abstraction** is one of the four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP). It is the practice of **focusing on what an object does** rather than **how it does it**. By hiding unnecessary details and exposing only the essential aspects, abstraction helps developers work with complex systems in a simplified way.  

Think of a car: you know how to drive it (steering, acceleration, braking), but you don’t need to know how the engine works internally every time you drive. That’s abstraction at play.



## Why Abstraction Matters
- **Reduces Complexity**: Developers interact with higher-level concepts without being overwhelmed by implementation details.  
- **Improves Maintainability**: Internal changes don’t affect external usage if the abstract interface remains the same.  
- **Encourages Reuse**: Abstract classes and interfaces provide blueprints for multiple concrete implementations.  
- **Supports Polymorphism**: Allows interchangeable behavior at runtime.  



## Ways to Achieve Abstraction in Java
1. **Abstract Classes**
   - Can have both abstract methods (without implementation) and concrete methods.  
   - Used when there is a partial common implementation.  

   ```java
   abstract class Vehicle {
       abstract void start(); // abstract method
       
       void stop() {          // concrete method
           System.out.println("Vehicle stopped.");
       }
   }

   class Car extends Vehicle {
       @Override
       void start() {
           System.out.println("Car engine started.");
       }
   }

   public class Main {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           Vehicle v = new Car();
           v.start(); // Car engine started.
           v.stop();  // Vehicle stopped.
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Interfaces**
   - Define only abstract methods (until Java 8), now can also have **default** and **static** methods.  
   - Used when multiple unrelated classes share a common contract.  

   ```java
   interface Payment {
       void pay(double amount);
   }

   class CreditCardPayment implements Payment {
       public void pay(double amount) {
           System.out.println("Paid $" + amount + " via Credit Card.");
       }
   }

   class UpiPayment implements Payment {
       public void pay(double amount) {
           System.out.println("Paid $" + amount + " via UPI.");
       }
   }

   public class Main {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           Payment p = new UpiPayment();
           p.pay(1000);
       }
   }
   ```



## Real-World Examples
- **Databases**: JDBC provides an abstract interface; the actual database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle) provides implementations.  
- **Payment Systems**: Payment gateways abstract the underlying banking systems, exposing a simple API.  
- **Operating Systems**: Filesystems abstract storage devices, letting you use files without worrying about hardware.  



## Interview Corner
**Q1: Difference between abstraction and encapsulation?**  
- **Abstraction**: Hides implementation details by exposing essential behavior (focuses on *what*).  
- **Encapsulation**: Restricts direct access to implementation details (focuses on *how*).  

**Q2: When to use an abstract class vs interface?**  
- Use an **abstract class** when classes share common behavior.  
- Use an **interface** when multiple classes (possibly unrelated) need to follow the same contract.  

**Q3: How has abstraction evolved in Java 8+?**  
- Interfaces can now have **default methods**, enabling code reuse while maintaining abstraction.  



## Key Takeaways
- Abstraction simplifies systems by modeling only what matters.  
- Achieved in Java using **abstract classes** and **interfaces**.  
- Promotes maintainability, reusability, and polymorphism.  
- Common in frameworks, APIs, and real-world enterprise systems.
