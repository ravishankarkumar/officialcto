# Design Principles: Building Robust, Maintainable Systems

## Overview
Design principles provide essential guidelines for writing high-quality, maintainable, and scalable software, ensuring your code is robust, modular, and intuitive. This section’s **12 lessons** cover critical principles like SOLID, DRY, KISS, YAGNI, Law of Demeter, Separation of Concerns, Principle of Least Astonishment, and GRASP, equipping you to design elegant Java systems. Whether applying SOLID to an e-commerce payment system or using the Law of Demeter in a social app, these principles enhance your design skills. By mastering them, you’ll create reliable software and mentor others effectively.

Inspired by *Clean Code*, *Effective Java*, and *Design Patterns* by Gang of Four, this section emphasizes practical Java applications, covering foundational principles for professional software engineering. Each lesson includes real-world examples and practice exercises to advance your skills in the *Official CTO* journey to becoming a better engineer.

## Learning Objectives
- Master **SOLID principles** for modular, extensible code.
- Learn **DRY**, **KISS**, and **YAGNI** for simplicity and efficiency.
- Apply **Law of Demeter**, **Separation of Concerns**, **POLA**, and **GRASP** for intuitive, decoupled design.
- Design scalable, maintainable Java systems with clean code (Section 9) and design patterns (Section 3).

## Lessons
1. **Introduction to Design Principles** (15 min)  
   Explore why design principles guide better code, contrasting with patterns. Example: Principles in an e-commerce platform’s architecture.

2. **Single Responsibility Principle** (20 min)  
   Learn SRP to ensure one class has one job. Example: Separating payment logic in a retail app.

3. **Open-Closed Principle** (20 min)  
   Apply OCP to extend without modifying code. Example: Adding new payment types in a cloud system.

4. **Liskov Substitution Principle** (20 min)  
   Understand LSP for substitutable subclasses. Example: Polymorphic payment processors.

5. **Interface Segregation Principle** (20 min)  
   Use ISP for small, focused interfaces. Example: Client-specific interfaces in a social app.  
   [Start Lesson →](/interview-section/design-principles/interface-segregation-principle)

6. **Dependency Inversion Principle** (20 min)  
   Apply DIP to depend on abstractions. Example: Injecting services in a notification system.  
   [Start Lesson →](/interview-section/design-principles/dependency-inversion-principle)

7. **DRY: Don’t Repeat Yourself** (20 min)  
   Learn DRY to eliminate code duplication. Example: Refactoring a user manager for a social app.  
   [Start Lesson →](/interview-section/design-principles/dry-principle)

8. **KISS: Keep It Simple, Stupid** (20 min)  
   Apply KISS to simplify code and systems. Example: Streamlining a booking system for a travel platform.  
   [Start Lesson →](/interview-section/design-principles/kiss-principle)

9. **YAGNI: You Aren’t Gonna Need It** (20 min)  
   Use YAGNI to avoid unnecessary features. Example: Simplifying a dashboard for a cloud app.  
   [Start Lesson →](/interview-section/design-principles/yagni-principle)

10. **Law of Demeter (Principle of Least Knowledge)** (20 min)  
    Apply LoD to reduce coupling by limiting object interactions. Example: Simplifying a user profile system in a social app.  
    [Start Lesson →](/interview-section/design-principles/law-of-demeter)

11. **Separation of Concerns** (20 min)  
    Learn SoC to modularize functionality. Example: Separating UI and logic in an e-commerce app.  
    [Start Lesson →](/interview-section/design-principles/separation-of-concerns)

12. **POLA and GRASP Principles** (20 min)  
    Apply POLA for intuitive code and GRASP for responsibility assignment. Example: Designing a fraud detection system.  
    [Start Lesson →](/interview-section/design-principles/pola-grasp-principles)
