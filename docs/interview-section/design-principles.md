# Design Principles: Building Robust, Maintainable Systems

## Overview
Design principles provide essential guidelines for writing high-quality, maintainable, and scalable software, ensuring your code is robust, modular, and intuitive.  
This section’s **18 lessons** cover critical principles like SOLID, DRY, KISS, YAGNI, Law of Demeter, Composition over Inheritance, Programming to an Interface, Favor Immutability, and more — equipping you to design elegant Java systems.  

By mastering these principles, you’ll create reliable software and explain your decisions clearly in interviews. This hub is inspired by *Clean Code*, *Effective Java*, and *Head First Design Patterns*, with a strong focus on practical Java applications.

## Learning Objectives
- Master **SOLID principles** for modular, extensible code.  
- Learn **DRY**, **KISS**, and **YAGNI** for simplicity and efficiency.  
- Apply **Law of Demeter**, **Separation of Concerns**, **Information Hiding**, and **High Cohesion/Low Coupling** for decoupled design.  
- Understand modern guidelines like **Composition over Inheritance**, **Favor Immutability**, and **Principle of Least Privilege**.  
- Connect principles to **clean code** and **design patterns** in later sections.

## Lessons

1. **Introduction to Design Principles**  
   Why principles matter, and how they differ from design patterns.  
   [Start Lesson →](/interview-section/design-principles/intro-design-principles)

2. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**  
   One class, one job.  
   [Start Lesson →](/interview-section/design-principles/single-responsibility-principle)

3. **Open-Closed Principle (OCP)**  
   Open for extension, closed for modification.  
   [Start Lesson →](/interview-section/design-principles/open-closed-principle)

4. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**  
   Subtypes must be substitutable for base types.  
   [Start Lesson →](/interview-section/design-principles/liskov-substitution-principle)

5. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**  
   Small, specific interfaces for flexibility.  
   [Start Lesson →](/interview-section/design-principles/interface-segregation-principle)

6. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**  
   Depend on abstractions, not concretions.  
   [Start Lesson →](/interview-section/design-principles/dependency-inversion-principle)

7. **Programming to an Interface, not an Implementation**  
   Design against contracts, not concrete classes.  
   [Start Lesson →](/interview-section/design-principles/program-to-interface)

8. **Composition over Inheritance**  
   Favor object composition to reduce rigidity.  
   [Start Lesson →](/interview-section/design-principles/composition-over-inheritance)

9. **DRY: Don’t Repeat Yourself**  
   Eliminate duplication with reusable abstractions.  
   [Start Lesson →](/interview-section/design-principles/dry-principle)

10. **KISS: Keep It Simple, Stupid**  
    Strive for simplicity in code and design.  
    [Start Lesson →](/interview-section/design-principles/kiss-principle)

11. **YAGNI: You Aren’t Gonna Need It**  
    Don’t build features until you actually need them.  
    [Start Lesson →](/interview-section/design-principles/yagni-principle)

12. **Law of Demeter (Principle of Least Knowledge)**  
    Minimize coupling by limiting object interactions.  
    [Start Lesson →](/interview-section/design-principles/law-of-demeter)

13. **Separation of Concerns**  
    Modularize functionality into distinct layers or modules.  
    [Start Lesson →](/interview-section/design-principles/separation-of-concerns)

14. **Information Hiding**  
    Hide internal details, expose only necessary APIs.  
    [Start Lesson →](/interview-section/design-principles/information-hiding)

15. **High Cohesion & Low Coupling**  
    Group related responsibilities; minimize dependencies.  
    [Start Lesson →](/interview-section/design-principles/high-cohesion-low-coupling)

16. **Favor Immutability**  
    Prefer immutable designs for safety and clarity.  
    [Start Lesson →](/interview-section/design-principles/favor-immutability)

17. **Principle of Least Privilege / Least Authority**  
    Grant only the minimum rights necessary.  
    [Start Lesson →](/interview-section/design-principles/least-privilege)

18. **POLA and GRASP Principles**  
    Principle of Least Astonishment + General Responsibility Assignment Software Patterns.  
    [Start Lesson →](/interview-section/design-principles/pola-grasp-principles)
