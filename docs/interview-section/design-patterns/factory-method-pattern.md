# Factory Method Pattern in Java ‚Äì Payment Modes Example

*By Ravi Shankar ¬∑ officialcto.com*

## Introduction

When building applications, we often need to create objects based on **runtime input**.  
For example, in a payment gateway system, users might choose to pay with **Credit Card**, **UPI**, or **PayPal**.  

If we simply scatter `new CreditCardPayment()` and `new UpiPayment()` everywhere in our code, it becomes **hard to maintain, extend, and test**.  

The **Factory Method pattern** provides a clean way to handle this problem by **centralizing object creation**.

---

## The Problem: Without a Factory

Imagine this naive approach:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Direct instantiation
        Payment payment = new CreditCardPayment();
        payment.pay(1000);

        Payment upi = new UpiPayment();
        upi.pay(500);
    }
}
```

Looks fine at first. But what if tomorrow we add:
- **PayPalPayment**
- **CryptoPayment**
- **NetBankingPayment**

We‚Äôd need to change the client code in multiple places.  
That‚Äôs a violation of the **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)** ‚Äî code should be *open for extension, closed for modification*.

---

## Enter the Factory Method Pattern

Instead of the client directly instantiating concrete classes, we introduce a **factory** that decides which `Payment` object to return based on input.

---

## Code Walkthrough

### 1. The Product (Abstract Class)

```java
abstract class Payment {
    public abstract void pay(int amount);
}
```

All payment modes extend this abstract class and implement their own logic.

---

### 2. Concrete Products

```java
public class CreditCardPayment extends Payment {
    @Override
    public void pay(int amount) {
        System.out.println("Paid " + amount + " using Credit Card.");
    }
}

public class UpiPayment extends Payment {
    @Override
    public void pay(int amount) {
        System.out.println("Paid " + amount + " using UPI.");
    }
}
```

---

### 3. The Factory

```java
public class PaymentsFactory {
    public static Payment createPayment(String type) {
        if (type.equalsIgnoreCase("CREDIT_CARD")) {
            return new CreditCardPayment();
        } else if (type.equalsIgnoreCase("UPI")) {
            return new UpiPayment();
        }
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Unknown payment type: " + type);
    }
}
```

üëâ The **factory method** here is `createPayment(String type)`.  
It decides which concrete class to instantiate, based on input.

---

### 4. The Client

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Payment payment1 = PaymentsFactory.createPayment("CREDIT_CARD");
        payment1.pay(1000);

        Payment payment2 = PaymentsFactory.createPayment("UPI");
        payment2.pay(500);
    }
}
```

Notice:  
- The client never uses `new`.  
- It only depends on `Payment` (the abstract class).  
- Creation logic is isolated in `PaymentsFactory`.

            +----------------+
            |   Payment      |  <---- Abstract Product
            +----------------+
            | + pay(amount)  |
            +----------------+
                 ^        ^
                 |        |
    +----------------+  +----------------+
    | CreditCardPayment | |   UpiPayment  |
    +----------------+  +----------------+

            +---------------------+
            |   PaymentsFactory   |  <---- Factory
            +---------------------+
            | + createPayment()   |
            +---------------------+
```

## Why This is Factory Method

- **Client is decoupled** from concrete classes.  
- **Factory encapsulates creation logic**.  
- **Adding new payment modes** only requires updating the factory (or registering new types).  

---

## Advantages

‚úÖ Centralized object creation  
‚úÖ Client code is clean and depends only on abstractions  
‚úÖ Easy to add new payment types  
‚úÖ Improved testability ‚Äî you can swap payment modes without touching client logic  

---

## Limitations

‚ö†Ô∏è The current implementation requires editing the factory every time you add a new payment mode (switch/if chain grows).  
‚ö†Ô∏è Static factories are harder to extend compared to registry-based or DI-driven factories.  
‚ö†Ô∏è It‚Äôs not the **pure GoF Factory Method pattern** (which uses subclassed creators) ‚Äî this is a **Simple Factory**, often confused with Factory Method.  

---

## TODOs & Suggested Improvements

1. **Use `enum` instead of raw strings**  
   ```java
   enum PaymentType { CREDIT_CARD, UPI }
   ```

2. **Registry-based Factory**  
   Use a `Map<String, Supplier<Payment>>` to avoid `if-else` clutter.  

3. **Abstract Factory**  
   If you need *families of related products* (e.g., `Payment`, `Refund`, `Invoice` for each provider), use the **Abstract Factory** pattern instead.  

4. **Dependency Injection**  
   In real systems, payment objects often need configs, credentials, and clients. A DI framework (Spring) can manage that.  

---

## Conclusion

The Factory Method pattern (or more precisely, the **Simple Factory** approach we implemented) is a **clean and practical solution** for problems where object creation depends on runtime input.  

Our **payment modes example** demonstrates how to keep client code clean, avoid hard-coded instantiation, and make the system easier to extend.  

In real-world systems, factories often evolve into **registry-based factories** or get integrated with **dependency injection frameworks** for maximum flexibility.
