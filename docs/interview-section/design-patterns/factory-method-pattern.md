# Factory Method Pattern

## Overview
The Factory Method pattern is a creational design pattern that provides a flexible way to create objects by delegating instantiation to subclasses. In this third lesson of Section 3 in the *Official CTO* journey, we explore the **Factory Method pattern**, its implementation in Java, and its applications in system design. Whether building a payment processor for a retail app or a content delivery system for a social platform, this pattern ensures extensibility and modularity. By mastering Factory Method, you’ll create scalable Java systems and mentor others effectively.

Inspired by *Design Patterns* by Gang of Four, *Head First Design Patterns*, and *Clean Code*, this 20-minute lesson covers the concepts, a practical Java example with a UML diagram, and practice exercises to advance your skills. Let’s continue the journey to becoming a better engineer!

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the **Factory Method pattern** and its role as a creational pattern.
- Learn to implement a **thread-safe Factory Method** in Java.
- Apply **OOP principles** (Section 2, Lecture 1) and **UML** (Section 2, Lecture 2) to Factory Method design.
- Use the pattern in real-world scenarios with clean code practices (Section 9).

## Why the Factory Method Pattern Matters
The Factory Method pattern enables flexible object creation without hardcoding class dependencies, making systems easier to extend. Early in my career, I used it to build a payment processor for a retail app, allowing new payment types to be added seamlessly. This pattern—leveraging polymorphism and abstraction—enhances scalability and maintainability. Explaining it clearly showcases your mentorship skills.

In software engineering, the Factory Method pattern helps you:
- **Enhance Extensibility**: Add new object types without modifying existing code.
- **Reduce Coupling**: Delegate instantiation to subclasses.
- **Improve Maintainability**: Write modular, clean code (Section 9).
- **Teach Effectively**: Share flexible design solutions with teams.

## Key Concepts
### 1. Factory Method Pattern Overview
The Factory Method pattern defines an interface for creating objects but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.

**Structure**:
- **Abstract Creator**: Defines the factory method (e.g., `createPayment()`).
- **Concrete Creators**: Implement the factory method to create specific objects.
- **Product Interface**: Defines the object type (e.g., `Payment`).
- **Concrete Products**: Implement the product interface (e.g., `CreditCardPayment`).

### 2. Thread Safety
In multi-threaded environments, factories may need synchronization to ensure safe object creation:
- Use `synchronized` or `ConcurrentHashMap` for thread-safe access.
- Ensure stateless factories where possible.

### 3. Use Cases
- Creating payment processors for different payment types.
- Generating UI components for various platforms.
- Instantiating services based on configuration.

**Example**: A payment factory creating `CreditCardPayment` or `PayPalPayment` objects.

## Code Example: Payment Processor Factory
Let’s implement a thread-safe payment processor factory for a retail app, with a UML class diagram.

### UML Class Diagram
```
+---------------------+
|  PaymentFactory     |
+---------------------+
| +createPayment(type: String): Payment |
+---------------------+
            |
            | implements
+---------------------+
|      Payment        |
+---------------------+
| +process(amount: double, userId: String) |
+---------------------+
            |
            | extends
+---------------------+       +---------------------+
| CreditCardPayment   |       |   PayPalPayment     |
+---------------------+       +---------------------+
| +process            |       | +process            |
+---------------------+       +---------------------+
```

### Java Implementation
```java
import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap;

// Payment interface
public interface Payment {
    void process(double amount, String userId);
}

// CreditCardPayment class
public class CreditCardPayment implements Payment {
    @Override
    public void process(double amount, String userId) {
        System.out.println("Processing $" + amount + " via Credit Card for " + userId);
    }
}

// PayPalPayment class
public class PayPalPayment implements Payment {
    @Override
    public void process(double amount, String userId) {
        System.out.println("Processing $" + amount + " via PayPal for " + userId);
    }
}

// PaymentFactory class
public class PaymentFactory {
    private static final ConcurrentHashMap<String, Payment> paymentCache = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
    
    public Payment createPayment(String type) {
        return paymentCache.computeIfAbsent(type, key -> {
            switch (key.toLowerCase()) {
                case "creditcard":
                    return new CreditCardPayment();
                case "paypal":
                    return new PayPalPayment();
                default:
                    throw new IllegalArgumentException("Unknown payment type: " + key);
            }
        });
    }
    
    // Example usage
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        PaymentFactory factory = new PaymentFactory();
        
        // Simulate concurrent payment processing
        Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
            Payment payment = factory.createPayment("creditcard");
            payment.process(100.0, "user1");
        });
        Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> {
            Payment payment = factory.createPayment("paypal");
            payment.process(50.0, "user2");
        });
        
        t1.start();
        t2.start();
        
        try {
            t1.join();
            t2.join();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        // Output: Processing $100.0 via Credit Card for user1
        //         Processing $50.0 via PayPal for user2
    }
}
```
- **Factory Method and OOP Principles**:
  - **Encapsulation**: Private `paymentCache` for thread-safe caching.
  - **Polymorphism**: `Payment` interface supports multiple payment types.
  - **Abstraction**: `PaymentFactory` hides instantiation logic.
  - **Thread Safety**: Uses `ConcurrentHashMap` for safe concurrent access (Section 2, Lecture 4).
  - **Clean Code**: Meaningful names, modularity (Section 9).
- **Big O**: O(1) for `createPayment` with cache, O(n) for cache miss.
- **Edge Cases**: Handles unknown payment types, concurrent creation.

**Systematic Approach**:
- Clarified requirements (create payment processors, support extensibility).
- Designed UML diagram to model `PaymentFactory`, `Payment`, and concrete payments.
- Implemented Java classes with Factory Method and thread safety.
- Tested with `main` method for concurrent usage.

## Real-World Application
Imagine building a payment processor for a retail app, where the Factory Method pattern allows seamless addition of new payment types (e.g., CryptoPayment) without modifying existing code. Thread-safe caching ensures efficient, concurrent processing. This approach—leveraging Factory Method for extensibility—enhances scalability and demonstrates your ability to mentor teams on robust design.

## Practice Exercises
Apply the Factory Method pattern with these exercises:
- **Easy**: Design a UML diagram and Java code for a `LoggerFactory` creating `ConsoleLogger` and `FileLogger`.
- **Medium**: Implement a thread-safe `NotificationFactory` for `EmailNotification` and `PushNotification` (Section 3, Lecture 1).
- **Medium**: Create a `DatabaseConnectionFactory` for `MySQLConnection` and `PostgreSQLConnection`.
- **Hard**: Design a `ContentFactory` for a media app, creating `VideoContent` and `ArticleContent` with thread safety.

Try implementing one exercise in Java with a UML diagram, ensuring thread safety and clean code principles.

## Conclusion
The Factory Method pattern equips you to design flexible, extensible Java systems for object creation. By mastering this creational pattern, you’ll optimize software, ensure maintainability, and teach others effectively. This advances your progress in Section 3 of the *Official CTO* journey.
