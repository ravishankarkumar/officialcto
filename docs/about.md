# About

## Who I Am
I’m a software engineer with over eight years of experience building scalable e-commerce platforms, notification systems, and AI cloud infrastructure. With a strong background in cloud technologies and a deep commitment to the craft of software engineering, I bring practical insights to this platform.

## The Official CTO Journey
*Official CTO* began as a personal endeavor to document what I learn while growing in my career. At senior levels, one of the most important skills is the ability to **share knowledge clearly**—both through writing and mentoring. This blog is my way of practicing that skill, while also creating a resource for others.

Even if readership is small, writing helps me solidify my own learning. Think of this blog as both **my personal engineering notes** and **a guide for others preparing for interviews or sharpening their fundamentals**.

Since many of the skills required to be a great engineer overlap with those tested in interviews, I’m framing my learnings in that format. This makes them easier to revisit, practice, and apply.

## About the Blog Name
You may be wondering about the domain name. *Official CTO* is deliberately bold and eye-catching—something memorable that reflects my aspirations. I aim to grow in the tech field and one day serve as CTO of a large technology company. The name serves as both a vision for the future and a brand that readers can easily recall.
