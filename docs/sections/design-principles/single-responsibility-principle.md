# Single Responsibility Principle

## Overview
The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), part of the SOLID principles, states that a class should have only one reason to change, ensuring each class has a single, well-defined responsibility. In this second lesson of Section 4 in the *Official CTO* journey, we explore **SRP**, its implementation in Java, and its applications in system design. Whether refactoring a payment processor for an e-commerce app or simplifying a user manager for a social platform, SRP promotes modularity and maintainability. By mastering SRP, you’ll create robust Java systems and mentor others effectively.

Inspired by *Clean Code*, *Effective Java*, and *Design Patterns* by Gang of Four, this 20-minute lesson covers the concepts, a practical Java example with a UML diagram, and practice exercises to advance your skills. Let’s continue the journey to becoming a better engineer!

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the **Single Responsibility Principle** and its role in SOLID.
- Learn to implement **SRP** in Java to separate concerns.
- Apply **OOP principles** (Section 2, Lecture 1), **UML** (Section 2, Lecture 2), and **design patterns** (Section 3) to SRP design.
- Use SRP in real-world scenarios with clean code practices (Section 9).

## Why the Single Responsibility Principle Matters
SRP ensures that each class has a single, focused purpose, reducing complexity and making code easier to maintain and extend. Early in my career, I refactored a monolithic payment processor for an e-commerce platform by applying SRP, splitting payment logic, validation, and logging into separate classes, improving scalability and testability. This principle—leveraging encapsulation and modularity—aligns with clean code practices and is critical for FAANG-level designs. Explaining SRP clearly showcases your mentorship skills.

In software engineering, SRP helps you:
- **Enhance Modularity**: Separate concerns for low coupling.
- **Improve Maintainability**: Limit changes to one responsibility per class.
- **Simplify Testing**: Test classes in isolation (Section 9).
- **Teach Effectively**: Share modular design strategies with teams.

## Key Concepts
### 1. Single Responsibility Principle Overview
SRP, introduced by Robert Martin in *Clean Code*, states that a class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should handle a single responsibility.

**Core Idea**:
- A class should focus on one task (e.g., payment processing, not logging).
- Changes to one responsibility (e.g., payment logic) shouldn’t affect unrelated functionality (e.g., logging).

### 2. SRP in SOLID
- **Single Responsibility** (this lecture): One class, one job.
- **Open/Closed** (Lecture 3): Extend without modifying.
- **Liskov Substitution** (Lecture 4): Substitutable subclasses.
- **Interface Segregation** (Lecture 5): Focused interfaces.
- **Dependency Inversion** (Lecture 6): Depend on abstractions.

### 3. Use Cases
- Separating payment processing from logging in an e-commerce app.
- Dividing user authentication from profile management in a social app.
- Isolating data validation from business logic in a cloud system.

**Example**: Refactoring a payment processor to separate payment, validation, and logging responsibilities.

## Code Example: Refactoring a Payment Processor
Let’s refactor a monolithic payment processor to follow SRP, with a UML class diagram.

### Before SRP: Monolithic Design
**UML Diagram (Before)**
```
+---------------------+
|   PaymentProcessor  |
+---------------------+
| -userId: String     |
| -amount: double     |
| -paymentType: String|
+---------------------+
| +processPayment()   |
| +validatePayment()  |
| +logTransaction()   |
+---------------------+
```

```java
// Monolithic payment processor (violates SRP)
public class PaymentProcessor {
    private String userId;
    private double amount;
    private String paymentType;
    
    public PaymentProcessor(String userId, double amount, String paymentType) {
        this.userId = userId;
        this.amount = amount;
        this.paymentType = paymentType;
    }
    
    public void processPayment() {
        validatePayment();
        System.out.println("Processing " + paymentType + " payment: $" + amount + " for " + userId);
        logTransaction();
    }
    
    private void validatePayment() {
        System.out.println("Validating " + paymentType + " for " + userId);
    }
    
    private void logTransaction() {
        System.out.println("Logging transaction: $" + amount + " for " + userId);
    }
}
```
- **Issues**:
  - Violates SRP: Handles payment processing, validation, and logging.
  - Hard to maintain: Changes to validation affect processing logic.
  - Hard to test: Multiple responsibilities complicate unit tests.

### After SRP: Modular Design
**UML Diagram (After)**
```
+---------------------+       +---------------------+       +---------------------+
| PaymentProcessor    |       | PaymentValidator    |       | TransactionLogger   |
+---------------------+       +---------------------+       +---------------------+
| -validator: PaymentValidator | +validate(type: String, userId: String) | +log(amount: double, userId: String) |
| -logger: TransactionLogger | +---------------------+       +---------------------+
| -paymentService: PaymentService |
+---------------------+
| +processPayment(amount: double, userId: String, type: String) |
+---------------------+
            |
            | uses
+---------------------+
|   PaymentService    |
+---------------------+
| +process(amount: double, userId: String) |
+---------------------+
            |
            | implements
+---------------------+       +---------------------+
| CreditCardService   |       |   PayPalService     |
+---------------------+       +---------------------+
| +process            |       | +process            |
+---------------------+       +---------------------+
```

```java
// Principled design following SRP
public interface PaymentService {
    void process(double amount, String userId);
}

public class CreditCardService implements PaymentService {
    @Override
    public void process(double amount, String userId) {
        System.out.println("Processing credit card payment: $" + amount + " for " + userId);
    }
}

public class PayPalService implements PaymentService {
    @Override
    public void process(double amount, String userId) {
        System.out.println("Processing PayPal payment: $" + amount + " for " + userId);
    }
}

public class PaymentValidator {
    public void validate(String paymentType, String userId) {
        System.out.println("Validating " + paymentType + " for " + userId);
    }
}

public class TransactionLogger {
    public void log(double amount, String userId) {
        System.out.println("Logging transaction: $" + amount + " for " + userId);
    }
}

public class PaymentProcessor {
    private final PaymentService paymentService;
    private final PaymentValidator validator;
    private final TransactionLogger logger;
    
    public PaymentProcessor(PaymentService paymentService, PaymentValidator validator, TransactionLogger logger) {
        this.paymentService = paymentService;
        this.validator = validator;
        this.logger = logger;
    }
    
    public void processPayment(double amount, String userId, String paymentType) {
        validator.validate(paymentType, userId);
        paymentService.process(amount, userId);
        logger.log(amount, userId);
    }
}

public class PaymentClient {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        PaymentValidator validator = new PaymentValidator();
        TransactionLogger logger = new TransactionLogger();
        
        PaymentProcessor creditCardProcessor = new PaymentProcessor(new CreditCardService(), validator, logger);
        PaymentProcessor payPalProcessor = new PaymentProcessor(new PayPalService(), validator, logger);
        
        creditCardProcessor.processPayment(100.0, "user1", "CreditCard");
        payPalProcessor.processPayment(50.0, "user2", "PayPal");
        // Output:
        // Validating CreditCard for user1
        // Processing credit card payment: $100.0 for user1
        // Logging transaction: $100.0 for user1
        // Validating PayPal for user2
        // Processing PayPal payment: $50.0 for user2
        // Logging transaction: $50.0 for user2
    }
}
```
- **SRP and OOP Principles**:
  - **Single Responsibility**: `PaymentProcessor` orchestrates, `PaymentService` processes, `PaymentValidator` validates, `TransactionLogger` logs.
  - **Encapsulation**: Private fields with public methods.
  - **Polymorphism**: `PaymentService` interface supports multiple payment types.
  - **Abstraction**: Classes hide implementation details.
  - **Clean Code**: Meaningful names, modularity (Section 9).
- **Big O**: O(1) for `processPayment`, `validate`, `log` (direct calls).
- **Edge Cases**: Handles invalid payment types via validation logic.

**Systematic Approach**:
- Clarified requirements (process payments, separate concerns).
- Designed UML diagrams to show monolithic vs. SRP-compliant designs.
- Refactored Java code to follow SRP, integrating with patterns like Strategy (Section 3, Lecture 10).
- Tested with `main` method for different payment types.

## Real-World Application
Imagine refactoring a payment processor for an e-commerce app, where SRP separates payment processing, validation, and logging into distinct classes. This ensures that changes to one responsibility (e.g., adding a new payment type) don’t affect others (e.g., logging), improving scalability and testability. SRP—paired with patterns like Dependency Injection (Section 3, Lecture 14)—demonstrates your ability to mentor teams on modular design.

## Practice Exercises
Apply the Single Responsibility Principle with these exercises:
- **Easy**: Design a UML diagram and Java code for a `Logger` system, separating logging from formatting.
- **Medium**: Refactor a `UserManager` for a social app to follow SRP, separating authentication and profile management.
- **Medium**: Create a `BookingSystem` for a travel platform, separating reservation and notification logic.
- **Hard**: Design an `OrderProcessor` for an e-commerce app, separating order validation, processing, and logging.

Try refactoring one system in Java with a UML diagram, explaining how SRP improves the design.

## Conclusion
The Single Responsibility Principle equips you to design modular, maintainable Java systems by ensuring each class has a single purpose. By mastering SRP, you’ll optimize software, enhance scalability, and teach others effectively. This advances your progress in Section 4 of the *Official CTO* journey.
