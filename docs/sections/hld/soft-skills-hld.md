# Soft Skills for HLD Interviews

High-Level Design (HLD) interviews are not only about technical depth but also about **how you think, communicate, and handle ambiguity**.  
This section focuses on the soft skills that help you stand out.

---

## 1. Think Out Loud

- Always **verbalize your thought process**.  
- Don’t jump directly to a final solution → explain intermediate steps.  
- Helps interviewer follow your reasoning and give hints if needed.  

---

## 2. Clarify Requirements Early

- Start by asking **functional vs non-functional requirements**.  
- Confirm assumptions: scale, latency, consistency, fault tolerance.  
- Example: *“Do we expect millions of users or just thousands?”*  
- This prevents overengineering or underengineering.  

---

## 3. Structure Your Approach

- Follow a **framework**:  
  1. Clarify requirements.  
  2. Estimate scale (QPS, storage).  
  3. Propose baseline solution (monolith).  
  4. Scale step by step (caching, replication, sharding, async).  
- Use diagrams if allowed (whiteboard, online tools).  

---

## 4. Call Out Trade-offs

- Explicitly state trade-offs instead of hiding them.  
- Examples:  
  - *“We can use strong consistency but it may reduce availability.”*  
  - *“CDNs reduce latency but are costly for dynamic data.”*  
- Interviewers value **awareness of compromises**.  

---

## 5. Use Real-World Examples

- Anchor your design with **case studies**:  
  - *“Instagram started with Postgres + Memcached + CDN.”*  
  - *“Netflix runs its own CDN (Open Connect).”*  
- Shows you know how theory maps to practice.  

---

## 6. Manage Time Effectively

- Typical HLD interview = 45–60 minutes.  
- Don’t spend 30 minutes only on DB schema.  
- Allocate time:  
  - 5–10 min → requirements + estimates.  
  - 20–30 min → core design + trade-offs.  
  - 10–15 min → extensions, scaling, Q&A.  

---

## 7. Communicate Under Pressure

- If stuck → state the challenge, propose alternatives.  
- Example: *“I see replication lag issue here. One option is async, another is quorum writes.”*  
- Interviewers often nudge if they see you thinking in the right direction.  

---

## 8. Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Over-optimizing too early.  
- Ignoring requirements.  
- Not checking interviewer’s cues.  
- Staying silent when unsure.  

---

## 9. Final Tips

- **Be structured, not perfect.**  
- **Trade-offs > final answer.**  
- **Communication = as important as design.**  
- **Learn to say “it depends” with reasoning.**
