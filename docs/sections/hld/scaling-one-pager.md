# Scaling to Millions (One-Pager)

This is a **quick-read checklist** for designing systems that can scale from a single server to millions of users.  
Useful for **interviews** and **real-world scaling decisions**.

---

## 1. Start Simple → Scale Later

- Begin with a **monolith**: single server with app + DB + cache.  
- Scale **step by step**, don’t overengineer too early.  

---

## 2. Vertical Scaling

- Increase CPU, RAM, disk of existing server.  
- Simple, quick fix.  
- Limits reached quickly → move to horizontal scaling.  

---

## 3. Horizontal Scaling

- Add more servers → load balance traffic.  
- Requires **stateless app servers** (session externalized).  
- Use **load balancers** (Nginx, HAProxy, ELB).  

---

## 4. Database Scaling

- **Replication** → primary for writes, replicas for reads.  
- **Sharding** → partition data by userID/orderID.  
- **Indexes** → speed up queries but add write cost.  
- **Caching** → Redis/Memcached to reduce DB load.  

---

## 5. Caching & CDN

- **App caching** → Redis/Memcached (session, hot data).  
- **Database query caching** → results stored in cache.  
- **CDN caching** → static files, images, videos at edge.  
- Watch out for cache invalidation & hot keys.  

---

## 6. Asynchronous Processing

- Offload heavy tasks (email, video processing).  
- Use **message queues** (Kafka, RabbitMQ, SQS).  
- Workers consume jobs asynchronously.  

---

## 7. Observability & Reliability

- **Monitoring** → metrics dashboards (Prometheus, Datadog).  
- **Logging** → centralized logs (ELK, Splunk).  
- **Tracing** → distributed tracing (Jaeger, OpenTelemetry).  
- **High availability** → replication, failover, multi-region.  

---

## 8. Security & Cost

- Secure endpoints (OAuth2, JWT, TLS).  
- DDoS protection, rate limiting.  
- Optimize infra costs: autoscaling, spot instances, caching.  

---

## Quick Checklist

✅ Monolith → Vertical Scaling → Horizontal Scaling.  
✅ Replication + Sharding for DB.  
✅ Caching + CDN.  
✅ Async processing with queues.  
✅ Observability (metrics, logs, tracing).  
✅ Reliability (replication, failover).  
✅ Security (auth, encryption, rate limits).  
✅ Cost awareness.  

---

## Interview Tip

In interviews, when asked *“How do you scale to millions?”*:  

- Walk through this checklist step by step.  
- Start simple → scale progressively.  
- Call out **trade-offs** at each stage.
