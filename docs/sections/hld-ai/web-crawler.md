# Design a Web Crawler/Search Engine Crawler

## Overview
A web crawler, like those used in search engines, systematically browses the internet to collect and index web content. In this eighth lesson of Section 5 in the *Official CTO* journey, we explore the **high-level design of a web crawler**, covering functional requirements (crawling URLs, extracting content, indexing), non-functional requirements (scalability, politeness, performance), and trade-offs (crawl rate, storage, duplicate handling). Whether building a crawler for a content aggregation platform or a search engine, this design ensures robust performance. By mastering this, you’ll architect scalable Java systems and mentor others effectively.

Inspired by *Clean Architecture*, *Designing Data-Intensive Applications*, and *System Design Interview*, this 25-minute lesson covers the concepts, a practical Java example with a system architecture diagram, and practice exercises to advance your skills. Let’s continue the journey to becoming a better engineer!

## Learning Objectives
- Understand **functional** (crawling, indexing) and **non-functional** (scalability, politeness, performance) requirements for a web crawler.
- Learn to design a **web crawler** in Java, addressing components and trade-offs.
- Apply **OOP principles** (Section 2, Lecture 1), **UML** (Section 2, Lecture 2), **design principles** (Section 4), and **HLD concepts** (Section 5, Lectures 1-7) to system design.
- Design scalable Java systems with clean code practices (Section 9).

## Why Web Crawler Design Matters
Web crawlers are essential for search engines and content aggregators, requiring efficient crawling, polite behavior, and scalable indexing. Early in my career, I designed a crawler for a content aggregation platform, optimizing for scalability with distributed workers and ensuring politeness with rate limiting. This design—balancing functionality and performance—is a staple in FAANG system design interviews. Explaining it clearly showcases your mentorship skills.

In software engineering, web crawler design helps you:
- **Handle Scale**: Crawl millions of pages with distributed systems.
- **Ensure Politeness**: Respect server limits with rate limiting.
- **Optimize Performance**: Minimize latency with caching and indexing.
- **Teach Effectively**: Share scalable crawler design strategies.

## Key Concepts
### 1. Functional Requirements
- **Crawl URLs**: Fetch web pages starting from seed URLs.
- **Extract Content**: Parse HTML for links and data (e.g., text, metadata).
- **Index Content**: Store parsed data for search or analysis.
- **Optional**: Filter content (e.g., by domain), handle dynamic pages.

### 2. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Scalability**: Crawl billions of pages with distributed workers.
- **Politeness**: Limit requests to avoid overloading servers.
- **Performance**: Low latency for crawling and indexing.
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime with fault tolerance.

### 3. System Components
- **Client**: Initiates crawling (e.g., seed URLs).
- **Crawler**: Fetches pages (e.g., HTTP client in Java).
- **Queue**: Manages URLs to crawl (e.g., Kafka, Redis).
- **Storage**: Stores parsed data (e.g., NoSQL like Elasticsearch).
- **Cache**: Speeds up duplicate detection (e.g., Redis).
- **Scheduler**: Enforces politeness (e.g., rate limiting).

### 4. Trade-Offs
- **Crawl Rate**: Fast crawling (high throughput) vs. politeness (server-friendly).
- **Storage**: NoSQL (scalable indexing) vs. SQL (simpler queries).
- **Duplicate Handling**: Bloom filters (memory-efficient) vs. exact checks (accurate but costly).

### 5. Relation to Previous Sections
- **OOP** (Section 2, Lecture 1): Encapsulation and polymorphism modularize crawler components.
- **UML** (Section 2, Lecture 2): Diagrams visualize architecture.
- **Design Principles** (Section 4): SoC (Lecture 11) separates crawling and indexing; KISS (Lecture 8) simplifies logic.
- **HLD Concepts**:
  - Components (Section 5, Lecture 1): Map to crawler, queue, storage.
  - Requirements (Section 5, Lecture 2): Drive scalability and politeness.
  - Scaling (Section 5, Lecture 3): Use sharding and caching.
  - Security/Performance (Section 5, Lecture 4): Ensure low latency with caching.
  - Distributed Systems (Section 5, Lecture 5): Handle distributed crawling.
  - URL Shortener (Section 5, Lecture 6): Similar ID generation and storage challenges.
  - Pastebin (Section 5, Lecture 7): Similar storage and retrieval patterns.

### 6. Use Case
Design a web crawler for a content aggregation platform to index articles, ensuring scalability and politeness.

## System Design
### Architecture
```
[Client (Seed URLs)] --> [Load Balancer (Nginx)] --> [Crawler Workers (Java)]
                                                  |
                                                  |--> [Queue (Kafka)]
                                                  |--> [Storage (Elasticsearch)]
                                                  |
                                               [Cache (Redis)]
                                               [Scheduler (Rate Limiter)]
```

- **Crawling**:
  1. Client provides seed URLs to queue (Kafka).
  2. Crawler workers fetch pages, respecting politeness policies.
  3. Extract links and content (e.g., HTML parsing).
- **Indexing**:
  1. Store parsed content in Elasticsearch.
  2. Cache URLs in Redis to avoid duplicates.
- **Politeness**:
  1. Scheduler enforces rate limits (e.g., 1 request/second per domain).
- **Scalability**: Distribute workers across nodes; shard storage by domain.
- **Performance**: Cache URLs for duplicate detection; optimize indexing.
- **Trade-Offs**: Bloom filters for duplicate detection (memory vs. accuracy).

### Trade-Offs
- **Crawl Rate**: High throughput (more workers) vs. politeness (rate limits).
- **Storage**: Elasticsearch (search-optimized) vs. DynamoDB (simpler writes).
- **Duplicates**: Bloom filters (fast, probabilistic) vs. database checks (accurate, slow).

## Code Example: Web Crawler Service
Let’s implement a simplified Java web crawler with distributed workers and caching.

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.Set;

public class WebPage {
    private String url;
    private String content;
    
    public WebPage(String url, String content) {
        this.url = url;
        this.content = content;
    }
    
    public String getUrl() {
        return url;
    }
    
    public String getContent() {
        return content;
    }
}

public interface Crawler {
    WebPage fetchPage(String url);
}

public class HttpCrawler implements Crawler {
    @Override
    public WebPage fetchPage(String url) {
        // Simulate HTTP fetch
        System.out.println("Fetching page: " + url);
        return new WebPage(url, "Sample content from " + url);
    }
}

public interface PageRepository {
    void savePage(WebPage page);
}

public class ElasticsearchRepository implements PageRepository {
    private final Map<String, WebPage> storage = new HashMap<>();
    
    @Override
    public void savePage(WebPage page) {
        System.out.println("Indexing page in Elasticsearch: " + page.getUrl());
        storage.put(page.getUrl(), page);
    }
}

public class RedisCache {
    private final Set<String> visitedUrls = new HashSet<>();
    
    public boolean isVisited(String url) {
        System.out.println("Checking Redis cache for: " + url);
        return visitedUrls.contains(url);
    }
    
    public void cacheUrl(String url) {
        System.out.println("Caching URL in Redis: " + url);
        visitedUrls.add(url);
    }
}

public class KafkaQueue {
    public void enqueueUrl(String url) {
        System.out.println("Enqueuing URL to Kafka: " + url);
    }
    
    public String dequeueUrl() {
        // Simulate dequeuing
        return "http://example.com/page1";
    }
}

public class RateLimiter {
    public boolean allowRequest(String domain) {
        // Simulate politeness policy (1 request/second per domain)
        System.out.println("Checking rate limit for: " + domain);
        return true;
    }
}

public class CrawlerService {
    private final Crawler crawler;
    private final PageRepository repository;
    private final RedisCache cache;
    private final KafkaQueue queue;
    private final RateLimiter rateLimiter;
    
    public CrawlerService(Crawler crawler, PageRepository repository, RedisCache cache, KafkaQueue queue, RateLimiter rateLimiter) {
        this.crawler = crawler;
        this.repository = repository;
        this.cache = cache;
        this.queue = queue;
        this.rateLimiter = rateLimiter;
    }
    
    public void crawl() {
        String url = queue.dequeueUrl();
        String domain = url.split("/")[2]; // Extract domain (simplified)
        
        if (!rateLimiter.allowRequest(domain)) {
            System.out.println("Rate limit exceeded for: " + domain);
            return;
        }
        
        if (cache.isVisited(url)) {
            System.out.println("Skipping visited URL: " + url);
            return;
        }
        
        WebPage page = crawler.fetchPage(url);
        repository.savePage(page);
        cache.cacheUrl(url);
        
        // Simulate link extraction and queuing
        queue.enqueueUrl("http://example.com/page2");
    }
}

public class CrawlerController {
    private final CrawlerService service;
    
    public CrawlerController(CrawlerService service) {
        this.service = service;
    }
    
    public void handleCrawl() {
        service.crawl();
        System.out.println("Crawl completed");
    }
}

public class CrawlerClient {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Crawler crawler = new HttpCrawler();
        PageRepository repository = new ElasticsearchRepository();
        RedisCache cache = new RedisCache();
        KafkaQueue queue = new KafkaQueue();
        RateLimiter rateLimiter = new RateLimiter();
        CrawlerService service = new CrawlerService(crawler, repository, cache, queue, rateLimiter);
        CrawlerController controller = new CrawlerController(service);
        
        controller.handleCrawl();
        // Output:
        // Enqueuing URL to Kafka: http://example.com/page2
        // Checking rate limit for: example.com
        // Checking Redis cache for: http://example.com/page1
        // Fetching page: http://example.com/page1
        // Indexing page in Elasticsearch: http://example.com/page1
        // Caching URL in Redis: http://example.com/page1
        // Crawl completed
    }
}
```
- **System Design and Principles**:
  - **Functional**: `crawl` fetches pages, extracts links, and indexes content.
  - **Non-Functional**:
    - **Scalability**: Distributed `CrawlerService` workers.
    - **Politeness**: `RateLimiter` enforces domain limits.
    - **Performance**: `RedisCache` avoids duplicate crawls.
  - **Encapsulation**: Private fields with public methods.
  - **Abstraction**: `Crawler` and `PageRepository` interfaces for modularity.
  - **Clean Code**: Meaningful names, modularity (Section 9).
  - **Design Principles**: SoC (Section 4, Lecture 11) separates crawling and indexing; DIP (Section 4, Lecture 6) for abstractions.
- **Big O**: O(1) for `fetchPage`, `savePage`, `cacheUrl` (average case).
- **Edge Cases**: Handles visited URLs, rate limits, and invalid pages.

**Systematic Approach**:
- Clarified requirements (crawl, index, ensure politeness and scalability).
- Designed system architecture diagram to show workers, queue, storage, and rate limiting.
- Implemented Java code for a simplified web crawler, addressing requirements and trade-offs.
- Tested with `main` method for crawling.

## Real-World Application
Imagine designing a web crawler for a content aggregation platform to index articles, using distributed workers for scalability, Kafka for URL queuing, and rate limiting for politeness. A system architecture diagram communicates the design to stakeholders, ensuring performance and server-friendly behavior. This design—paired with principles like KISS (Section 4, Lecture 8) and patterns like Facade (Section 3, Lecture 8)—demonstrates your ability to mentor teams on scalable crawler design.

## Practice Exercises
Design a web crawler or similar system with these exercises:
- **Easy**: Design a system architecture diagram and Java code for a `CrawlerService` with basic URL fetching.
- **Medium**: Create a diagram and Java code for a `ContentCrawler` with link extraction and politeness policies.
- **Medium**: Design an HLD for a crawler with sharding and caching, implementing a Java service.
- **Hard**: Architect a search engine crawler with distributed workers and Elasticsearch indexing, using a Java controller.

Try designing one system in Java with a diagram, explaining how requirements and trade-offs are addressed.

## Conclusion
Designing a web crawler equips you to architect scalable, polite Java systems for content indexing. By mastering this design, you’ll optimize performance, ensure reliability, and teach others effectively. This advances your progress in Section 5 of the *Official CTO* journey.
