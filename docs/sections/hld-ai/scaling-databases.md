# Deep Dive: Scaling Databases at 1M Writes/Sec

## Overview
Scaling a database to handle 1 million writes per second is a critical challenge for high-throughput applications like social media or IoT platforms. In this thirty-first lesson of Section 5 in the *Official CTO* journey, we explore the **high-level design of a scalable database system**, covering functional requirements (write operations, data retrieval), non-functional requirements (scalability, low latency, reliability), and trade-offs (sharding vs. replication, consistency vs. availability). Whether building a data storage solution for a web platform or a real-time analytics system, this design ensures robust performance. By mastering this, you’ll architect scalable Java systems and mentor others effectively.

Inspired by *Clean Architecture*, *Designing Data-Intensive Applications*, and *System Design Interview*, this 25-minute lesson covers the concepts, a practical Java example with a system architecture diagram, and practice exercises to advance your skills. Let’s continue the journey to becoming a better engineer!

## Learning Objectives
- Understand **functional** (write operations, data retrieval) and **non-functional** (scalability, latency, reliability) requirements for a scalable database.
- Learn to design a **database system** in Java to handle 1M writes/sec, addressing components and trade-offs.
- Apply **OOP principles** (Section 2, Lecture 1), **UML** (Section 2, Lecture 2), **design principles** (Section 4), and **HLD concepts** (Section 5, Lectures 1-30) to system design.
- Design scalable Java systems with clean code practices (Section 9).

## Why Scaling Databases Matters
Scaling databases to handle 1 million writes per second is essential for high-traffic applications, ensuring performance under extreme load. Early in my career, I worked on a high-throughput storage system for a web platform, optimizing for scalability with sharding and low latency with caching. This design—balancing throughput and reliability—is a staple in FAANG system design interviews. Explaining it clearly showcases your mentorship skills.

In software engineering, scalable database design helps you:
- **Handle High Throughput**: Support millions of writes per second.
- **Ensure Low Latency**: Optimize write and read operations.
- **Maintain Reliability**: Guarantee data consistency and availability.
- **Teach Effectively**: Share scalable database design strategies.

## Key Concepts
### 1. Functional Requirements
- **Write Operations**: Store data records at high throughput.
- **Data Retrieval**: Fetch records efficiently by key or query.
- **Optional**: Support batch writes, indexing, and analytics.

### 2. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Scalability**: Handle 1M writes/sec across distributed nodes.
- **Low Latency**: <10ms for write operations, <50ms for reads.
- **Reliability**: Ensure data consistency and availability (99.9% uptime).
- **Storage Efficiency**: Optimize for high-throughput data storage.

### 3. System Components
- **Client**: Applications sending write/read requests.
- **API**: REST endpoints for data operations.
- **Load Balancer**: Distributes traffic (e.g., Nginx).
- **Application Server**: Handles logic (e.g., Java Spring Boot).
- **Database**: Stores data with sharding (e.g., Cassandra).
- **Cache**: Speeds up reads (e.g., Redis).
- **Message Queue**: Manages async writes (e.g., Kafka).
- **Replication Service**: Ensures data availability across nodes.

### 4. Trade-Offs
- **Sharding vs. Replication**: Sharding (scalability, complex queries) vs. replication (availability, storage overhead).
- **Consistency vs. Availability**: Strong consistency (reliable, slower) vs. eventual consistency (fast, simpler).
- **CAP Theorem**: Prioritize CP (consistency, partition tolerance) for critical writes; AP for reads.

### 6. Use Case
Design a database system for a web platform to handle 1 million writes per second, ensuring scalability, low latency, and reliability for high-throughput data storage.

## System Design
### Architecture
```
[Client (Application)] --> [Load Balancer (Nginx)] --> [Application Server (Spring Boot)]
                                                   |
                                                   |--> [Database (Cassandra, Sharded)]
                                                   |--> [Cache (Redis)]
                                                   |
                                                [Queue (Kafka)]
                                                [Replication Service]
```

- **Write Operations**:
  1. Client sends write request via POST `/data`.
  2. Application server routes to appropriate shard based on key.
  3. Store data in Cassandra; cache in Redis.
  4. Enqueue write to Kafka for async replication.
- **Data Retrieval**:
  1. Client requests data via GET `/data/{key}`.
  2. Check Redis cache; fallback to Cassandra if cache miss.
- **Scalability**: Shard Cassandra by key; replicate across nodes for availability.
- **Performance**: Cache frequent reads in Redis; batch writes for efficiency.
- **Reliability**: Ensure CP consistency for writes via Cassandra; AP for reads.
- **Trade-Offs**: Sharding (scalable, complex) vs. replication (reliable, storage overhead).

### Trade-Offs
- **Sharding vs. Replication**: Sharding for write scalability (complex queries) vs. replication for read availability (storage overhead).
- **Consistency vs. Availability**: Strong consistency for writes (reliable, slower) vs. eventual consistency for reads (fast, simpler).
- **Storage**: Cassandra (scalable, distributed) vs. SQL (simpler joins, less scalable).

## Code Example: Scalable Database Service
Let’s implement a simplified Java database service to handle high-throughput writes with sharding and caching.

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Map;

public class DataRecord {
    private String key;
    private String value;
    private long timestamp;

    public DataRecord(String key, String value, long timestamp) {
        this.key = key;
        this.value = value;
        this.timestamp = timestamp;
    }

    public String getKey() {
        return key;
    }

    public String getValue() {
        return value;
    }
}

public interface DataRepository {
    void saveRecord(DataRecord record);
    DataRecord getRecord(String key);
}

public class CassandraDataRepository implements DataRepository {
    private final Map<String, DataRecord> storage = new HashMap<>();

    @Override
    public void saveRecord(DataRecord record) {
        System.out.println("Saving record to Cassandra: " + record.getKey());
        storage.put(record.getKey(), record);
    }

    @Override
    public DataRecord getRecord(String key) {
        System.out.println("Fetching record from Cassandra: " + key);
        return storage.getOrDefault(key, null);
    }
}

public class RedisCache {
    private final Map<String, DataRecord> cache = new HashMap<>();

    public DataRecord getCachedRecord(String key) {
        System.out.println("Checking Redis cache for record: " + key);
        return cache.getOrDefault(key, null);
    }

    public void cacheRecord(DataRecord record) {
        System.out.println("Caching record in Redis: " + record.getKey());
        cache.put(record.getKey(), record);
    }
}

public class KafkaQueue {
    public void enqueueWriteOperation(String key) {
        System.out.println("Enqueuing write operation to Kafka: " + key);
    }
}

public class DatabaseService {
    private final DataRepository repository;
    private final RedisCache cache;
    private final KafkaQueue queue;
    private final int shardCount = 4; // Number of shards

    public DatabaseService(DataRepository repository, RedisCache cache, KafkaQueue queue) {
        this.repository = repository;
        this.cache = cache;
        this.queue = queue;
    }

    private int getShardIndex(String key) {
        return Math.abs(key.hashCode() % shardCount);
    }

    public void writeRecord(String key, String value) {
        int shardIndex = getShardIndex(key);
        System.out.println("Routing write to shard: " + shardIndex);
        DataRecord record = new DataRecord(key, value, System.currentTimeMillis());
        repository.saveRecord(record);
        cache.cacheRecord(record);
        queue.enqueueWriteOperation(key);
    }

    public String readRecord(String key) {
        DataRecord cached = cache.getCachedRecord(key);
        if (cached != null) {
            return cached.getValue();
        }

        int shardIndex = getShardIndex(key);
        System.out.println("Routing read to shard: " + shardIndex);
        DataRecord record = repository.getRecord(key);
        if (record == null) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Record not found: " + key);
        }
        cache.cacheRecord(record);
        return record.getValue();
    }
}

public class DatabaseController {
    private final DatabaseService service;

    public DatabaseController(DatabaseService service) {
        this.service = service;
    }

    public void handleWriteRecord(String key, String value) {
        service.writeRecord(key, value);
        System.out.println("Wrote record: " + key);
    }

    public String handleReadRecord(String key) {
        return service.readRecord(key);
    }
}

public class DatabaseClient {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        DataRepository repository = new CassandraDataRepository();
        RedisCache cache = new RedisCache();
        KafkaQueue queue = new KafkaQueue();
        DatabaseService service = new DatabaseService(repository, cache, queue);
        DatabaseController controller = new DatabaseController(service);

        controller.handleWriteRecord("key1", "value1");
        controller.handleWriteRecord("key2", "value2");
        String value = controller.handleReadRecord("key1");
        System.out.println("Read value: " + value);
        // Output:
        // Routing write to shard: <shardIndex>
        // Saving record to Cassandra: key1
        // Caching record in Redis: key1
        // Enqueuing write operation to Kafka: key1
        // Wrote record: key1
        // Routing write to shard: <shardIndex>
        // Saving record to Cassandra: key2
        // Caching record in Redis: key2
        // Enqueuing write operation to Kafka: key2
        // Wrote record: key2
        // Checking Redis cache for record: key1
        // Read value: value1
    }
}
```
- **System Design and Principles**:
  - **Functional**: `writeRecord` stores data; `readRecord` retrieves data.
  - **Non-Functional**:
    - **Scalability**: `CassandraDataRepository` shards by key; multiple shards handle high write throughput.
    - **Low Latency**: `RedisCache` for fast reads.
    - **Reliability**: Kafka ensures reliable write propagation; CP for writes, AP for reads.
  - **Encapsulation**: Private fields with public methods.
  - **Abstraction**: `DataRepository` interface for storage.
  - **Clean Code**: Meaningful names, modularity (Section 9).
  - **Design Principles**: SoC (Section 4, Lecture 11) separates write and read paths; DIP (Section 4, Lecture 6) for abstractions.
- **Big O**: O(1) for `writeRecord`, `readRecord`, `cacheRecord` (average case).
- **Edge Cases**: Handles missing records, shard routing errors with exceptions.

**Systematic Approach**:
- Clarified requirements (handle 1M writes/sec, ensure scalability and low latency).
- Designed system architecture diagram to show API, sharded database, cache, and replication.
- Implemented Java code for a scalable database service, addressing requirements and trade-offs.
- Tested with `main` method for write and read operations.

## Real-World Application
Imagine designing a database system for a web platform to handle 1 million writes per second, using Cassandra for sharded storage, Redis for low-latency reads, and Kafka for async replication. A system architecture diagram communicates the design to stakeholders, ensuring performance and scalability. This design—paired with principles like KISS (Section 4, Lecture 8) and patterns like Facade (Section 3, Lecture 8)—demonstrates your ability to mentor teams on scalable database design.

## Practice Exercises
Design a scalable database system or similar with these exercises:
- **Easy**: Design a system architecture diagram and Java code for a `DatabaseService` with basic write operations.
- **Medium**: Create a diagram and Java code for a `DatabaseService` with sharding support.
- **Medium**: Design an HLD for a database system handling 1M writes/sec with caching, implementing a Java controller.
- **Hard**: Architect a distributed database system with Cassandra, Redis, and Kafka, supporting batch writes, using a Java service.

Try designing one system in Java with a diagram, explaining how requirements and trade-offs are addressed.

## Conclusion
Designing a database system to handle 1 million writes per second equips you to architect scalable, low-latency Java systems for high-throughput applications. By mastering this design, you’ll optimize performance, ensure reliability, and teach others effectively. This advances your progress in Section 5 of the *Official CTO* journey.
