# High-Level Design (HLD) Series: From Basics to Millions of Users

High-Level Design (HLD) is at the heart of **system design interviews** and **real-world architecture**.  
This series is structured to take you from **fundamentals â†’ advanced distributed systems â†’ practical case studies**, so you can use it as a course or jump into topics as needed.

## ðŸ“‘ Articles in This Series

### **1. Foundations**
1. [System Design Mindset](/sections/hld/foundations/system-design-mindset.md)  
   Clarifying requirements â†’ constraints â†’ bottlenecks â†’ scaling.  
   Always start simple (monolith) and scale step by step.  
2. [Workload Estimation](/sections/hld/foundations/workload-estimation.md)  
   Requests/sec, QPS, throughput.  
   Storage needs (GB â†’ TB â†’ PB).  
   Network bandwidth & latency awareness.
