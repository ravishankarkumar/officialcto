# Algorithms and Data Structures: Foundational Problem-Solving Patterns

## Overview
Algorithms and data structures are the backbone of software engineering, enabling you to solve complex problems efficiently and elegantly. This section’s **15 lessons** dive into reusable patterns and advanced techniques, from two-pointers to segment trees, to sharpen your coding craft. Whether you're optimizing a search algorithm or tackling a graph problem, these lessons teach you to think critically and write robust solutions, inspired by real-world challenges like social network connectivity or financial analytics.

Designed for senior engineers, this section emphasizes pattern recognition over rote memorization, drawing from industry standards like *Cracking the Coding Interview* and LeetCode. Each lesson includes practical examples, code snippets, and practice problems to help you grow as an engineer and mentor others.

## Learning Objectives
- Master core data structures (arrays, graphs, heaps) and their applications.
- Learn problem-solving patterns (e.g., sliding window, DFS) for efficient coding.
- Explore advanced algorithms (e.g., union-find, segment trees) for complex challenges.
- Write clean, optimized code that’s easy to maintain and explain.
