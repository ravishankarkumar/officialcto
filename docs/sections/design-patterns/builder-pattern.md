# Builder Pattern

## Overview
The Builder pattern is a creational design pattern that allows step-by-step construction of complex objects, ensuring flexibility and readability. In this fifth lesson of Section 3 in the *Official CTO* journey, we explore the **Builder pattern**, its implementation in Java, and its applications in system design. Whether building customer orders for an e-commerce system or configuring a user profile for a social app, this pattern simplifies object creation. By mastering Builder, you’ll create scalable Java systems and mentor others effectively.

Inspired by *Design Patterns* by Gang of Four, *Head First Design Patterns*, and *Clean Code*, this 20-minute lesson covers the concepts, a practical Java example with a UML diagram, and practice exercises to advance your skills. Let’s continue the journey to becoming a better engineer!

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the **Builder pattern** and its role as a creational pattern.
- Learn to implement a **thread-safe Builder** in Java.
- Apply **OOP principles** (Section 2, Lecture 1), **UML** (Section 2, Lecture 2), and creational patterns (Section 3, Lectures 2-4).
- Use the pattern in real-world scenarios with clean code practices (Section 9).

## Why the Builder Pattern Matters
The Builder pattern simplifies the creation of complex objects with many optional parameters, avoiding unwieldy constructors. Early in my career, I used it to streamline order creation in an e-commerce system, making the code more readable and extensible. This pattern—leveraging encapsulation and abstraction—enhances maintainability and flexibility. Explaining it clearly showcases your mentorship skills.

In software engineering, the Builder pattern helps you:
- **Simplify Object Creation**: Handle complex objects with optional fields.
- **Enhance Readability**: Use fluent interfaces for clear configuration.
- **Improve Extensibility**: Support new attributes without breaking code.
- **Teach Effectively**: Share structured design solutions with teams.

## Key Concepts
### 1. Builder Pattern Overview
The Builder pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing step-by-step configuration.

**Structure**:
- **Product**: The complex object (e.g., `Order`).
- **Builder Interface**: Defines methods for setting attributes (e.g., `setItem()`, `setQuantity()`).
- **Concrete Builder**: Implements the builder interface to construct the product.
- **Director**: Optionally orchestrates the builder (e.g., `OrderDirector`).

### 2. Comparison to Other Creational Patterns
- **Singleton** (Lecture 2): Ensures a single instance.
- **Factory Method** (Lecture 3): Creates one type of object.
- **Abstract Factory** (Lecture 4): Creates families of related objects.
- **Builder**: Constructs a single complex object step-by-step.

### 3. Thread Safety
In multi-threaded environments, builders should be stateless or synchronized:
- Use immutable products or thread-safe collections (e.g., `ConcurrentHashMap`).
- Ensure thread-safe construction if shared.

### 4. Use Cases
- Building complex orders with optional items.
- Configuring user profiles with variable settings.
- Creating documents with customizable attributes.

**Example**: An order builder for an e-commerce system with items, discounts, and shipping.

## Code Example: Order Builder
Let’s implement a thread-safe order builder for an e-commerce system, with a UML class diagram.

### Java Implementation
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

// Item class
public class Item {
    private String name;
    private double price;
    
    public Item(String name, double price) {
        this.name = name;
        this.price = price;
    }
    
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
    
    public double getPrice() {
        return price;
    }
}

// Order class (Product)
public class Order {
    private final List<Item> items;
    private final double discount;
    private final String shippingAddress;
    private final double total;
    
    private Order(OrderBuilder builder) {
        this.items = new ArrayList<>(builder.items);
        this.discount = builder.discount;
        this.shippingAddress = builder.shippingAddress;
        this.total = calculateTotal();
    }
    
    private double calculateTotal() {
        double sum = items.stream().mapToDouble(Item::getPrice).sum();
        return sum - discount;
    }
    
    public List<Item> getItems() {
        return new ArrayList<>(items); // Defensive copy
    }
    
    public double getDiscount() {
        return discount;
    }
    
    public String getShippingAddress() {
        return shippingAddress;
    }
    
    public double getTotal() {
        return total;
    }
}

// OrderBuilder class
public class OrderBuilder {
    protected List<Item> items;
    protected double discount;
    protected String shippingAddress;
    private final ReentrantLock lock;
    
    public OrderBuilder() {
        this.items = new ArrayList<>();
        this.discount = 0.0;
        this.shippingAddress = "";
        this.lock = new ReentrantLock();
    }
    
    public OrderBuilder addItem(Item item) {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            items.add(item);
            return this;
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }
    
    public OrderBuilder setDiscount(double discount) {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            this.discount = discount;
            return this;
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }
    
    public OrderBuilder setShippingAddress(String address) {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            this.shippingAddress = address;
            return this;
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }
    
    public Order build() {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            return new Order(this);
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }
}

// OrderDirector class
public class OrderDirector {
    public Order constructStandardOrder(OrderBuilder builder, Item item) {
        return builder.addItem(item)
                      .setShippingAddress("123 Main St")
                      .build();
    }
    
    public Order constructDiscountedOrder(OrderBuilder builder, Item item, double discount) {
        return builder.addItem(item)
                      .setDiscount(discount)
                      .setShippingAddress("123 Main St")
                      .build();
    }
}

// Example usage
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        OrderBuilder builder = new OrderBuilder();
        OrderDirector director = new OrderDirector();
        
        // Simulate concurrent order construction
        Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
            Order order = director.constructStandardOrder(builder, new Item("Book", 29.99));
            System.out.println("Standard Order Total: $" + order.getTotal());
        });
        
        Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> {
            Order order = director.constructDiscountedOrder(builder, new Item("Laptop", 999.99), 100.0);
            System.out.println("Discounted Order Total: $" + order.getTotal());
        });
        
        t1.start();
        t2.start();
        
        try {
            t1.join();
            t2.join();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        // Output: Standard Order Total: $29.99
        //         Discounted Order Total: $899.99
    }
}
```
- **Builder and OOP Principles**:
  - **Encapsulation**: Private fields in `Order` and `OrderBuilder` with getters.
  - **Abstraction**: `OrderBuilder` hides construction complexity.
  - **Thread Safety**: Uses `ReentrantLock` for concurrent building (Section 2, Lecture 4).
  - **Clean Code**: Fluent interface, meaningful names, modularity (Section 9).
- **Big O**: O(1) for `addItem`, `setDiscount`, `setShippingAddress`, `build`; O(n) for `getItems` copy.
- **Edge Cases**: Handles empty items, invalid discounts, concurrent builds.

**Systematic Approach**:
- Clarified requirements (construct orders with optional fields, thread-safe).
- Designed UML diagram to model `Order`, `OrderBuilder`, `OrderDirector`.
- Implemented Java classes with Builder pattern and thread safety.
- Tested with `main` method for concurrent order construction.

## Real-World Application
Imagine building customer orders for an e-commerce system, where the Builder pattern simplifies creating orders with optional items, discounts, and shipping details. Thread-safe construction ensures concurrent users can place orders without conflicts. This approach—leveraging Builder for flexibility—enhances scalability and demonstrates your ability to mentor teams on robust design.

## Practice Exercises
Apply the Builder pattern with these exercises:
- **Easy**: Design a UML diagram and Java code for a `UserProfileBuilder` to create user profiles with optional fields (e.g., bio, avatar).
- **Medium**: Implement a thread-safe `DocumentBuilder` for creating documents with sections and styles.
- **Medium**: Create a `MealBuilder` for a food delivery app, supporting dishes and dietary preferences.
- **Hard**: Design a `ReservationBuilder` for a travel platform, building bookings with rooms, dates, and extras.

Try implementing one exercise in Java with a UML diagram, ensuring thread safety and clean code principles.

## Conclusion
The Builder pattern equips you to design flexible, readable Java systems for complex object construction. By mastering this creational pattern, you’ll optimize software, ensure maintainability, and teach others effectively. This advances your progress in Section 3 of the *Official CTO* journey.
