# Capstone: Mixing Patterns in Real Interviews

## Overview
Complex problems in software engineering often require combining multiple algorithmic patterns to achieve elegant, efficient solutions. In this twelfth lesson of the *Official CTO* journey, we wrap up Section 1 with a **capstone on mixing patterns**, synthesizing techniques like two-pointers, hashing, graphs, dynamic programming (DP), and heaps. Whether building a recommendation system for a social app or optimizing a logistics platform, this lesson teaches you to integrate patterns for real-world challenges. By mastering this, you’ll write robust Java code, mentor others effectively, and excel in high-stakes scenarios like interviews.

Inspired by *Cracking the Coding Interview* and LeetCode, this 30-minute lesson covers the concepts, a practical Java example combining patterns, and practice problems to advance your skills. Let’s cap off Section 1 and continue the journey to becoming a better engineer!

## Learning Objectives
- Review **key algorithmic patterns** from Section 1 (two-pointers, hashing, graphs, DP, heaps).
- Learn to **combine patterns** for complex problems.
- Apply these techniques to optimize Java code for real-world and interview scenarios.
- Write clean, maintainable code, referencing Section 9 (Clean Code).

## Why Mixing Patterns Matters
Real-world systems and coding interviews often demand solutions that blend multiple techniques. Early in my career, I built a recommendation system for a social app, combining graph traversal (BFS) with hashing to suggest relevant connections efficiently. Mixing patterns—graphs for relationships, hashing for fast lookups, DP for optimization—enables scalable, elegant code. This capstone synthesizes Section 1’s lessons, preparing you to solve complex problems and teach others effectively.

In software engineering, mixing patterns helps you:
- **Optimize Performance**: Combine techniques for O(n log n) or better solutions.
- **Simplify Code**: Write clean, modular solutions (see Section 9).
- **Teach Effectively**: Explain integrated approaches to teams.

## Key Concepts
### 1. Review of Algorithmic Patterns
Section 1 covered these patterns:
- **Two-Pointers/Sliding Window**: Efficient array/string traversal (Lecture 2).
- **Prefix Sums/Hashing**: Fast range queries and lookups (Lecture 3).
- **Linked Lists**: Reversal and cycle detection (Lecture 4).
- **Stacks/Queues/BFS/DFS**: Priority and graph traversal (Lecture 5).
- **Trees**: Traversals and balancing (Lecture 6).
- **Graphs**: Shortest paths and topological sort (Lecture 7).
- **Heaps**: Priority queue operations (Lecture 8).
- **DP**: 1D and 2D optimization (Lectures 9-10).
- **Greedy/Bit Manipulation**: Local optima and low-level operations (Lecture 11).

### 2. Mixing Patterns
Complex problems often require multiple patterns:
- **Graph + Hashing**: Use BFS with a HashSet to avoid revisiting nodes.
- **Graph + DP**: Optimize paths with memoization for shortest paths.
- **Heap + Hashing**: Track top-k elements with a priority queue and HashMap.

**Key Strategy**: Identify the problem’s structure, select relevant patterns, and integrate them systematically.

## Code Example: Word Ladder
Let’s apply mixed patterns to a classic problem: *Given two words (beginWord and endWord) and a dictionary, find the shortest transformation sequence length from beginWord to endWord, where each step changes one letter, and the new word is in the dictionary.*

This combines **BFS** (Lecture 5) for shortest path and **hashing** (Lecture 3) for fast lookups.

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int ladderLength(String beginWord, String endWord, List<String> wordList) {
        // Convert wordList to HashSet for O(1) lookups
        Set<String> dictionary = new HashSet<>(wordList);
        if (!dictionary.contains(endWord)) return 0;
        
        // BFS queue: [word, level]
        Queue<String> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.offer(beginWord);
        Set<String> visited = new HashSet<>();
        visited.add(beginWord);
        int level = 1;
        
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int size = queue.size();
            for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
                String current = queue.poll();
                if (current.equals(endWord)) return level;
                
                // Generate neighbors by changing one letter
                char[] chars = current.toCharArray();
                for (int j = 0; j < chars.length; j++) {
                    char original = chars[j];
                    for (char c = 'a'; c <= 'z'; c++) {
                        chars[j] = c;
                        String neighbor = new String(chars);
                        if (dictionary.contains(neighbor) && !visited.contains(neighbor)) {
                            queue.offer(neighbor);
                            visited.add(neighbor);
                        }
                    }
                    chars[j] = original; // Restore original char
                }
            }
            level++; // Increment level after processing current level
        }
        
        return 0; // No transformation found
    }
}
```
- **Big O**: O(N * 26 * L) time (N = wordList size, L = word length, 26 letters per position), O(N) space (queue, HashSet).
- **Techniques**:
  - **BFS**: Finds shortest transformation path (Lecture 5).
  - **Hashing**: Uses HashSet for O(1) dictionary lookups (Lecture 3).
  - **Clean Code**: Modular, readable variable names (Section 9).
- **Edge Cases**: Handles no solution, empty wordList, same begin/end words.

**Systematic Approach**:
- Clarified input (beginWord, endWord, wordList).
- Explored naive solution (e.g., DFS, potentially longer paths).
- Optimized with BFS for shortest path and HashSet for fast lookups.
- Tested edge cases (e.g., endWord not in dictionary, single-letter words).

## Real-World Application
Imagine building a recommendation system for a social app, where you need to find the shortest sequence of related content (e.g., from one post to another via tags). Combining BFS (to explore connections) and hashing (to check valid tags) ensures efficient recommendations, much like the Word Ladder problem. This approach—mixing patterns for optimization—improves system performance and demonstrates your ability to mentor teams on scalable solutions.

## Practice Problems
Apply mixed patterns with these LeetCode problems:
- **Medium**: [Word Ladder](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder/) (BFS + hashing).
- **Medium**: [Top K Frequent Elements](https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/) (heap + hashing).
- **Hard**: [Shortest Path in a Grid with Obstacles Elimination](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-path-in-a-grid-with-obstacles-elimination/) (BFS + DP).
- **Hard**: [Word Ladder II](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder-ii/) (BFS + backtracking).

Try solving one problem in Java, using the systematic approach: clarify, explore, analyze, code, and explain.

## Conclusion
Mixing algorithmic patterns like BFS, hashing, and DP is essential for writing efficient, scalable Java code for complex problems. By mastering this capstone, you’ll optimize real-world systems, excel in challenging scenarios, and teach others effectively. This wraps up Section 1, setting you up for success in the journey to becoming a better software engineer.
