# Prefix Sums and Hashing

## Overview
Efficient algorithms are the cornerstone of scalable software systems. In this third lesson of the *Official CTO* journey, we explore **prefix sums and hashing techniques**, powerful tools for solving array and range query problems with optimal time complexity. These techniques enable you to write elegant Java code, whether analyzing user activity in a social app or processing transactions in an e-commerce platform. By mastering prefix sums and hashing, you’ll optimize solutions and mentor others effectively.

Inspired by *Cracking the Coding Interview* and LeetCode, this 20-minute lesson covers the concepts, a practical Java example, and practice problems to sharpen your skills. Let’s continue the journey to becoming a better engineer!

## Learning Objectives
- Understand **prefix sums** for efficient range query computations.
- Learn **hashing** with HashMap for fast lookups and pattern matching.
- Apply these techniques to optimize Java code from O(n²) to O(n).
- Solve real-world challenges with efficient algorithms.

## Why Prefix Sums and Hashing Matter
As a senior engineer, I’ve tackled performance bottlenecks in systems handling large datasets. Once, I optimized a user analytics feature in a social app, reducing query time from quadratic to linear using prefix sums and hashing. These techniques—prefix sums for cumulative calculations and hashing for instant lookups—are essential for scalable code. They streamline coding challenges and real-world systems, and explaining them clearly showcases your mentorship skills.

In software engineering, these techniques help you:
- **Optimize Performance**: Reduce time complexity (e.g., O(n²) to O(n)).
- **Simplify Code**: Write clean, maintainable solutions.
- **Teach Effectively**: Break down complex problems for teams.

## Key Concepts
### 1. Prefix Sums
Prefix sums precompute cumulative sums of an array, enabling O(1) range sum queries. For an array `nums`, the prefix sum at index `i` is the sum of elements from `0` to `i`.

**Formula**: `prefix[i] = nums[0] + nums[1] + ... + nums[i]`

**Range Sum Query**: To find the sum from index `i` to `j`, use `prefix[j] - prefix[i-1]`.

**Use Cases**:
- Computing subarray sums (e.g., sum of transactions in a time range).
- Optimizing range-based queries in analytics apps.

### 2. Hashing
Hashing uses a HashMap to store key-value pairs for O(1) average-case lookups. In algorithms, it tracks seen elements or indices to avoid redundant computations.

**Use Cases**:
- Finding subarrays with a target sum (e.g., using prefix sums with HashMap).
- Detecting duplicates or matching patterns (e.g., anagrams).

**Why Efficient?**: Both techniques reduce time complexity from O(n²) (nested loops) to O(n) (single pass with HashMap or precomputed sums), critical for large datasets.

## Code Example: Subarray Sum Equals K
Let’s apply these techniques to a classic problem: *Given an array of integers and a target sum k, find the number of subarrays that sum to k.*

### Naive Solution (O(n²))
```java
public class Solution {
    public int subarraySum(int[] nums, int k) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int sum = 0;
            for (int j = i; j < nums.length; j++) {
                sum += nums[j];
                if (sum == k) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
- **Big O**: O(n²) time (nested loops for all subarrays), O(1) space.
- **Issue**: Inefficient for large arrays (e.g., thousands of elements).

### Optimized Solution with Prefix Sums and Hashing (O(n))
```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class Solution {
    public int subarraySum(int[] nums, int k) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> prefixSums = new HashMap<>();
        prefixSums.put(0, 1); // Base case: empty subarray
        int sum = 0;
        int count = 0;
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            sum += num; // Current prefix sum
            if (prefixSums.containsKey(sum - k)) {
                count += prefixSums.get(sum - k); // Add count of subarrays summing to k
            }
            prefixSums.put(sum, prefixSums.getOrDefault(sum, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}
```
- **Big O**: O(n) time (single pass with HashMap), O(n) space (HashMap for prefix sums).
- **Techniques Applied**:
  - **Prefix Sums**: Track cumulative sum to compute range sums in O(1).
  - **Hashing**: Use HashMap to store prefix sums and their frequencies, finding `sum - k` in O(1).
  - **Systematic Approach**: Clarified input (array, k), explored naive solution, optimized with prefix sums and hashing, tested edge cases (e.g., empty array, k=0).

## Real-World Application
Imagine analyzing user activity in a social app, where you need to count time windows with a specific engagement score (e.g., sum of likes). A naive O(n²) approach, checking all time ranges, is too slow for millions of users. Using prefix sums and hashing, you can precompute engagement totals and use a HashMap to count matching windows in O(n). This technique—leveraging efficient data structures—improves system performance and demonstrates your ability to mentor teams on scalable solutions.

## Practice Problems
Apply prefix sums and hashing with these LeetCode problems:
- **Easy**: [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/) (hashing).
- **Medium**: [Subarray Sum Equals K](https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-sum-equals-k/) (prefix sums + hashing).
- **Medium**: [Continuous Subarray Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/continuous-subarray-sum/) (prefix sums with modulo).
- **Hard**: [Subarray Sums Divisible by K](https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-sums-divisible-by-k/) (advanced prefix sums).

Try solving one problem in Java, using the systematic approach: clarify, explore, analyze, code, and explain.

## Conclusion
Prefix sums and hashing are essential for writing efficient, scalable Java code. By mastering these techniques, you’ll solve array and range query problems faster, optimize real-world systems, and teach others effectively. These skills are your next step in becoming a better software engineer.
