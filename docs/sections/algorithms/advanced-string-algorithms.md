# Advanced String Algorithms

## Overview
String processing is a core skill in software engineering, powering search engines, text analytics, and more. In this fifteenth lesson of the *Official CTO* journey, we explore **advanced string algorithms** like Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) and Rabin-Karp, essential techniques for efficient pattern matching and substring search. Whether matching keywords in a search engine or analyzing logs in a cloud system, these tools sharpen your coding craft. By mastering them, you’ll write robust Java code and mentor others effectively.

Inspired by *Cracking the Coding Interview* and LeetCode, this 20-minute lesson covers the concepts, a practical Java example, and practice problems to advance your skills. Let’s continue the journey to becoming a better engineer!

## Learning Objectives
- Understand **KMP algorithm** for efficient pattern matching.
- Learn **Rabin-Karp** for hashing-based substring search.
- Apply these techniques to optimize Java code for string problems.
- Solve real-world challenges with efficient algorithms.

## Why Advanced String Algorithms Matter
String algorithms are critical for systems requiring fast text processing. Early in my career, I optimized a search engine feature by using KMP to match query patterns efficiently, reducing latency for large datasets. These techniques—KMP for exact matching, Rabin-Karp for probabilistic search—are essential for scalable code. Explaining them clearly showcases your mentorship skills.

In software engineering, these techniques help you:
- **Optimize Performance**: Reduce time complexity (e.g., O(n+m) vs. O(nm)).
- **Simplify Code**: Write clean, maintainable solutions.
- **Teach Effectively**: Break down complex string problems for teams.

## Key Concepts
### 1. Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) Algorithm
KMP uses a prefix table to avoid redundant comparisons in pattern matching, achieving O(n+m) time (n = text length, m = pattern length).

**How It Works**:
- Build a prefix table (longest proper prefix that is also a suffix).
- Use the table to skip unnecessary comparisons during matching.

**Use Cases**:
- Keyword search in a text editor.
- Log analysis for specific patterns.

**Time Complexity**: O(n+m) time, O(m) space.

### 2. Rabin-Karp Algorithm
Rabin-Karp uses rolling hashes to find substrings, comparing hash values before characters.

**How It Works**:
- Compute hash of pattern and text substring.
- Slide window, updating hash in O(1) using rolling hash.
- Verify matches to avoid hash collisions.

**Use Cases**:
- Substring search in a search engine.
- Plagiarism detection in documents.

**Time Complexity**: O(n+m) average, O(nm) worst-case, O(1) space.

## Code Example: KMP Pattern Matching
Let’s apply KMP to a classic problem: *Given a text and a pattern, find the starting index of the pattern in the text (or -1 if not found).*

### Naive Solution
```java
public class Solution {
    public int strStr(String haystack, String needle) {
        if (needle.isEmpty()) return 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i <= haystack.length() - needle.length(); i++) {
            int j = 0;
            while (j < needle.length() && haystack.charAt(i + j) == needle.charAt(j)) {
                j++;
            }
            if (j == needle.length()) return i;
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
```
- **Big O**: O(nm) time (n = haystack length, m = needle length), O(1) space.
- **Issue**: Inefficient for large texts due to repeated comparisons.

### KMP Optimized Solution
```java
public class Solution {
    public int strStr(String haystack, String needle) {
        if (needle.isEmpty()) return 0;
        
        int[] lps = computeLPS(needle); // Longest prefix suffix
        int i = 0, j = 0; // i = haystack index, j = needle index
        
        while (i < haystack.length()) {
            if (haystack.charAt(i) == needle.charAt(j)) {
                i++;
                j++;
            }
            if (j == needle.length()) {
                return i - j; // Pattern found
            }
            if (i < haystack.length() && haystack.charAt(i) != needle.charAt(j)) {
                if (j > 0) {
                    j = lps[j - 1]; // Use prefix table to skip
                } else {
                    i++;
                }
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
    
    private int[] computeLPS(String pattern) {
        int[] lps = new int[pattern.length()];
        int length = 0, i = 1;
        
        while (i < pattern.length()) {
            if (pattern.charAt(i) == pattern.charAt(length)) {
                length++;
                lps[i] = length;
                i++;
            } else if (length > 0) {
                length = lps[length - 1];
            } else {
                lps[i] = 0;
                i++;
            }
        }
        return lps;
    }
}
```
- **Big O**: O(n+m) time (single pass with prefix table), O(m) space (LPS array).
- **Technique**: KMP uses prefix table to skip redundant comparisons.
- **Edge Cases**: Handles empty needle, no match, pattern longer than text.

**Systematic Approach**:
- Clarified input (haystack, needle strings).
- Explored naive solution (O(nm) brute force).
- Optimized with KMP for O(n+m) using prefix table.
- Tested edge cases (e.g., empty strings, single character).

## Real-World Application
Imagine building a search engine where users query keywords in large documents. KMP enables efficient pattern matching, reducing search latency for millions of queries. Similarly, Rabin-Karp can quickly identify relevant substrings in a text analytics system. These techniques—leveraging advanced algorithms for efficiency—improve system performance and demonstrate your ability to mentor teams on scalable solutions.

## Practice Problems
Apply advanced string algorithms with these LeetCode problems:
- **Easy**: [Implement strStr()](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-strstr/) (KMP).

- **Hard**: [Shortest Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-palindrome/) (KMP).

Try solving one problem in Java, using the systematic approach: clarify, explore, analyze, code, and explain.
