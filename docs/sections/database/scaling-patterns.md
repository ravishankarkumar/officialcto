# Database Scaling Patterns

As applications grow, a single database server often becomes a bottleneck.  
To handle more users and data, we use **scaling patterns**.  

This article covers the **two fundamental approaches (vertical vs horizontal)** and the techniques of **replication and sharding**.

---

## 1. Vertical vs Horizontal Scaling

### 1.1 Vertical Scaling (Scale-Up)
- Add more power (CPU, RAM, SSD) to a single server.  
- Example: Upgrading from 4-core/16GB RAM ‚Üí 32-core/256GB RAM.  

**Pros**  
- Simple to implement.  
- No application changes needed.  
- Great short-term solution.  

**Cons**  
- Hardware has limits (can‚Äôt scale forever).  
- Expensive at higher tiers.  
- Still a single point of failure (SPOF).  

üëâ Used as a **first step**, but not sustainable long-term.

---

### 1.2 Horizontal Scaling (Scale-Out)
- Add more machines (nodes) to handle the load.  
- Example: Instead of one large server, use 10 smaller servers.  

**Pros**  
- Effectively unlimited scaling.  
- Fault tolerance improves (no single point of failure).  
- Cost-efficient with commodity hardware.  

**Cons**  
- Much more complex (distributed queries, replication, consistency).  
- Requires careful architecture.  

üëâ Used in **modern distributed systems** (e.g., Google Spanner, Cassandra).

---

## 2. Replication Strategies

Replication = **copying data across nodes**.  

### 2.1 Primary-Secondary Replication
- **Writes ‚Üí Primary**, **Reads ‚Üí Replicas**.  
- Example: MySQL with read replicas.  

**Benefits**  
- High availability.  
- Read scalability.  
- Disaster recovery.  

**Challenges**  
- Replication lag ‚Üí stale reads.  
- Failover complexity.  

---

### 2.2 Multi-Primary Replication
- **Writes allowed on multiple nodes**.  
- Example: PostgreSQL BDR, CouchDB.  

**Benefits**  
- Higher write availability.  
- Better geo-distribution.  

**Challenges**  
- Conflict resolution (last-write-wins, vector clocks).  
- Complex consistency guarantees.  

---

### 2.3 Geo-Replication
- Replicate data across **regions/data centers**.  
- Example: Spanner, Cosmos DB.  

**Benefits**  
- Low latency (closer to users).  
- Disaster resilience.  

**Challenges**  
- Cross-region latency.  
- Cost of synchronization.  

---

## 3. Sharding Techniques

Sharding = **splitting data into subsets** across nodes.  

### 3.1 Range-Based Sharding
- Partition data by value ranges (e.g., user IDs 1‚Äì1000, 1001‚Äì2000).  
- **Pros**: Easy to query ranges.  
- **Cons**: Hotspot risk (popular range gets overloaded).  

---

### 3.2 Hash-Based Sharding
- Apply a hash function on key ‚Üí assign to shard.  
- **Pros**: Even distribution of load.  
- **Cons**: Hard to do range queries.  

---

### 3.3 Directory-Based Sharding
- Use a lookup service that maps keys ‚Üí shards.  
- **Pros**: Flexible, dynamic rebalancing.  
- **Cons**: Directory is a single point of failure if not managed well.  

---

## 4. Combining Scaling Patterns

Most large-scale systems combine **replication + sharding**:

- **Sharded Cluster with Replication inside each Shard**  
  - Each shard stores a portion of the data.  
  - Each shard is replicated for fault tolerance.  

**Example Systems**:  
- MongoDB Sharded Cluster.  
- Cassandra (partitioning + replication).  
- Google Spanner (global sharding + replication).  

---

## 5. Choosing the Right Strategy

### Ask these questions:
1. Is the workload **read-heavy** or **write-heavy**?  
   - Read-heavy ‚Üí Replication.  
   - Write-heavy ‚Üí Sharding.  

2. Is the dataset **too large** for one machine?  
   - Yes ‚Üí Sharding.  

3. Is **high availability** a must?  
   - Yes ‚Üí Replication.  

4. Do you need **low-latency geo-distribution**?  
   - Yes ‚Üí Geo-replication.  

---

## 6. Interview Tips

- Start with **vertical scaling**, then move to **horizontal scaling**.  
- Always mention **replication lag** and **shard rebalancing** challenges.  
- Show awareness of combining strategies.  
- Tie answers back to **CAP/PACELC trade-offs**.  

üëâ Example Answer:  
*‚ÄúI‚Äôd first try vertical scaling. If the workload grows further, I‚Äôd move to horizontal scaling. For a read-heavy workload, replication makes sense. For write-heavy with large datasets, sharding is needed. In practice, I‚Äôd combine both ‚Äî each shard is replicated for HA.‚Äù*

## 7. Recap

- **Vertical scaling**: quick but limited.  
- **Horizontal scaling**: distributed, complex, scalable.  
- **Replication**: improves availability & read scaling.  
- **Sharding**: improves write scaling & storage capacity.  
- Real-world systems combine **both**.
