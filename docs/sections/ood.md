# Object-Oriented Design: Modeling Real-World Systems

## Overview
Object-Oriented Design (OOD) is the art of modeling real-world systems into modular, extensible software, bridging code and architecture. This section’s **8 lessons** dive into OOD principles, techniques, and patterns to sharpen your ability to design robust systems. Whether building an inventory manager for a travel platform or handling concurrency in a payment system, these lessons teach you to craft elegant Java code that’s maintainable and scalable. By mastering OOD, you’ll design better software and mentor others effectively.

Inspired by *Head First Design Patterns* and industry-standard practices, this section emphasizes practical design with Java, covering fundamentals like encapsulation, UML modeling, and advanced topics like concurrency. Each lesson includes real-world examples and practice problems to advance your skills in the *Official CTO* journey to becoming a better engineer.

## Learning Objectives
- Master **OOP fundamentals** (encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism).
- Learn **UML** for modeling system designs.
- Design **modular systems** with real-world applications (e.g., parking lot, inventory).
- Handle **concurrency** and **refactoring** in OOD for robust solutions.

## Lessons
1. **OOP Fundamentals** (15 min)  
   Explore encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism in Java to build modular systems. Example: Design a user management system for a social app.  
   [Start Lesson →](/sections/ood/oop-fundamentals)

2. **UML and Class Diagram Basics** (20 min)  
   Learn UML notation and class diagrams to visualize system designs. Example: Model relationships in an e-commerce platform.  
   [Start Lesson →](/sections/ood/uml-class-diagrams)

3. **Designing Simple Systems: Parking Lot** (25 min)  
   Design a parking lot system with classes and behaviors. Example: Manage parking spaces for a mall.  
   [Start Lesson →](/sections/ood/parking-lot-design)

4. **Handling Concurrency in OOD** (20 min)  
   Explore thread-safety in Java for concurrent systems. Example: Synchronize bookings in a ticket system.  
   [Start Lesson →](/sections/ood/concurrency-in-ood)

5. **Advanced OOD: Elevator System** (25 min)  
   Design an elevator system using state machines and polymorphism. Example: Control elevators in a high-rise building.  
   [Start Lesson →](/sections/ood/elevator-system-design)

6. **OOD for E-Commerce: Inventory Management** (25 min)  
   Design an inventory system for a large-scale travel platform. Example: Manage hotel bookings with extensibility.  
   [Start Lesson →](/sections/ood/ecommerce-inventory-management)

7. **Trade-Offs and Refactoring in OOD** (20 min)  
   Learn to balance design decisions and refactor for maintainability. Example: Refactor a payment system for flexibility; reference Section 10 for deeper refactoring.  
   [Start Lesson →](/sections/ood/trade-offs-refactoring)

8. **Mock Interview: Live OOD Session** (30 min)  
   Practice designing a system based on a viewer-submitted problem. Example: Design a library management system in real-time.  
   [Start Lesson →](/sections/ood/mock-interview-ood)
