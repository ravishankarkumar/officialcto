## Strategies for Conflict Resolution and Handling Failures
### 1. Conflict Resolution
- **Active Listening**: Hear all sides without interrupting (e.g., understand differing priorities in a project).
- **Constructive Feedback**: Focus on solutions, not blame (e.g., propose a compromise on resource allocation).
- **Mediation**: Facilitate discussions to align goals (e.g., mediate between engineering and product teams).
- **Empathy**: Acknowledge teammates’ perspectives to build trust.
- **Example**: Resolve a disagreement over feature prioritization by facilitating a data-driven discussion.

### 2. Handling Failures
- **Own the Mistake**: Admit errors transparently (e.g., “I misconfigured the telemetry system”).
- **Analyze Root Causes**: Use tools like 5 Whys or post-mortems (e.g., identify a telemetry misconfiguration).
- **Implement Improvements**: Propose and execute fixes (e.g., add validation checks).
- **Communicate Lessons**: Share learnings with the team to prevent recurrence.
- **Example**: Learn from a telemetry failure by implementing monitoring and improving reliability.

### STAR Example: Conflict Resolution
**Question**: “Tell me about a time you resolved a team conflict.”
- **Situation**: “Our team disagreed on the priority of features for a distributed telemetry system.”
- **Task**: “As a senior engineer, I was responsible for aligning the team.”
- **Action**: “I listened to both engineering and product perspectives, proposed a data-driven prioritization framework, and facilitated a meeting to reach consensus.”
- **Result**: “We agreed on priorities, delivering the system on time with 99% uptime.”

### STAR Example: Handling Failure
**Question**: “Tell me about a time you failed and what you learned.”
- **Situation**: “Our distributed telemetry system failed during a critical monitoring period.”
- **Task**: “I was responsible for diagnosing and fixing the issue.”
- **Action**: “I conducted a root cause analysis, identified a misconfiguration, and implemented automated validation checks.”
- **Result**: “We restored monitoring in 4 hours and improved system reliability by 20%.”

## FAANG-Specific Tips
