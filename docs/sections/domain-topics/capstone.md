# Capstone: Integrating All Sections

## Overview
Welcome to the tenth and final lecture of **Section 8: Domain-Specific Topics (Cloud, Infra, and Beyond)** in the *Official CTO* journey! This capstone lecture simulates a **FAANG-style system design interview**, integrating concepts from cloud fundamentals, IaC, containerization, distributed systems, monitoring, AI infra, microservices, CI/CD, and security. Through a mock interview with practical Java examples, we’ll prepare you to design scalable systems and articulate solutions. Drawing from my 8+ years of mentoring engineers, this 30-minute lesson equips you to excel in interviews and real-world projects. Let’s culminate your *Official CTO* journey with confidence!

Inspired by *Designing Data-Intensive Applications* and FAANG system design practices, this lesson provides a comprehensive mock interview, code examples, and strategies for success.

## Learning Objectives

## Mock Interview
Below is a simulated FAANG system design interview with 5 questions, responses, and Java code snippets integrating Section 8 concepts.

### Question 1: Design a Scalable Payment System (Amazon - AWS Expertise)
**Question**: “Design a scalable payment system with fraud prevention.”
- **Response**:
  - **Architecture**: Use AWS ECS for microservices, S3 for transaction logs, DynamoDB for storage, and AWS Fraud Detector for fraud prevention.
  - **Components**: API Gateway, user microservice, payment microservice, fraud detection service, CI/CD pipeline.
  - **Implementation**: Java-based microservice with fraud detection (from Lecture 9).
  - **Code Snippet**:
    ```java
    @RestController
    public class PaymentController {
        private final FraudDetector fraudDetector;

        public PaymentController(FraudDetector fraudDetector) {
            this.fraudDetector = fraudDetector;
        }

        @PostMapping("/payments")
        public ResponseEntity<String> processPayment(@RequestBody Transaction transaction) {
            if (fraudDetector.isFraudulent(transaction)) {
                return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.FORBIDDEN).body("Fraud detected");
            }
            // Process payment (e.g., save to DynamoDB)
            return ResponseEntity.ok("Payment processed");
        }
    }
    ```
- **Result**: Scaled to 1M transactions with 99.9% uptime, reduced fraud by 90%.

### Question 2: Deploy with CI/CD and Containers (Google - GKE)
**Question**: “How would you automate deployment for a microservices system?”
- **Response**:
  - **Architecture**: Use Docker for containerization, GKE for orchestration, and Cloud Build for CI/CD (Lecture 3, 8).
  - **Components**: Dockerfile, Kubernetes deployment, Cloud Build pipeline.
  - **Implementation**: GitHub Actions pipeline adapted for Cloud Build.
  - **Code Snippet** (Kubernetes YAML):
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: payment-service
    spec:
      replicas: 3
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: payment
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: payment
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: payment
            image: gcr.io/project/payment:latest
            ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
    ```
- **Result**: Deployed reliably, supporting 1M users with automated updates.

### Question 3: Monitor a Distributed System (Meta - Execution Speed)
**Question**: “Design a monitoring system for a real-time application.”
- **Response**:
  - **Architecture**: Use Elasticsearch for metrics and Lambda for real-time logging (Lecture 5).
  - **Components**: Metrics collection, alerts, visualization dashboard.
  - **Implementation**: Java-based telemetry logging (from Lecture 6).
  - **Code Snippet**:
    ```java
    public class MetricsLogger {
        private final RestHighLevelClient esClient;

        public MetricsLogger(String esEndpoint) {
            this.esClient = new RestHighLevelClient(RestClient.builder(new HttpHost(esEndpoint, 9200, "http")));
        }

        public void logMetrics(String service, double latency) throws IOException {
            Map<String, Object> metrics = new HashMap<>();
            metrics.put("service", service);
            metrics.put("latency_ms", latency);
            IndexRequest request = new IndexRequest("metrics").source(metrics, XContentType.JSON);
            esClient.index(request, RequestOptions.DEFAULT);
        }
    }
    ```
- **Result**: Detected issues in under 2 minutes, reducing downtime.

### Question 4: Apply CAP Theorem (Netflix - Freedom & Responsibility)
**Question**: “Design a fault-tolerant distributed system with CAP trade-offs.”
- **Response**:
  - **Architecture**: Choose AP (availability, partition tolerance) with DynamoDB, using Paxos-inspired consensus for leader election (Lecture 4).
  - **Components**: Microservices, DynamoDB, Kubernetes.
  - **Implementation**: Java-based leader election (from Lecture 4).
  - **Code Snippet**:
    ```java
    public class LeaderElection {
        private final Map<Integer, Node> nodes;

        public LeaderElection(int numNodes) {
            this.nodes = new HashMap<>();
            for (int i = 0; i < numNodes; i++) {
                nodes.put(i, new Node(i));
            }
        }

        public boolean proposeLeader(int proposerId, int candidateId) {
            int acceptCount = 0;
            int quorum = nodes.size() / 2 + 1;
            for (Node node : nodes.values()) {
                if (node.acceptProposal(proposerId, candidateId)) {
                    acceptCount++;
                }
            }
            return acceptCount >= quorum;
        }
    }
    ```
- **Result**: Achieved 99.9% uptime with consistent state.

### Question 5: Behavioral - Infrastructure Automation (Amazon - Ownership)
