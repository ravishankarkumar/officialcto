# Cloud Fundamentals: AWS/GCP/OCI

## Overview
Welcome to the first lecture of **Section 8: Domain-Specific Topics (Cloud, Infra, and Beyond)** in the *Official CTO* journey! Cloud computing is the backbone of modern software engineering, powering scalable systems at FAANG companies. In this 15-minute lesson, we explore **cloud fundamentals** for AWS, GCP, and OCI, covering key services like compute, storage, and networking. With a practical Java example for interacting with AWS S3, we’ll prepare you for FAANG interviews and real-world projects. Drawing from my 8+ years of mentoring engineers, this lecture equips you to master cloud basics. Let’s dive into your *Official CTO* journey to become a well-rounded engineer!

Inspired by *Designing Data-Intensive Applications* and cloud provider documentation, this lesson provides actionable insights, a code example, and strategies for cloud expertise.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand **AWS, GCP, and OCI** core services (compute, storage, networking).
- Learn to **apply cloud concepts** in scalable system design.
- Prepare for **FAANG interviews** with cloud-focused questions.
- Implement a **Java-based cloud interaction** (e.g., AWS S3).

## Why Cloud Fundamentals Matter
Cloud computing is essential for FAANG roles, enabling scalable, cost-effective systems. Drawing from my experience mentoring engineers, I’ve seen cloud expertise set candidates apart in interviews and leadership roles. This lecture ensures you can articulate cloud concepts, design systems, and align with industry trends.

In software engineering, cloud fundamentals help you:
- **Ace Interviews**: Answer cloud-related technical questions.
- **Design Scalable Systems**: Leverage cloud services for performance.
- **Optimize Costs**: Use services efficiently.
- **Drive Innovation**: Build modern, cloud-native applications.

## Key Concepts
### 1. Cloud Computing Overview
- **Definition**: On-demand computing resources (compute, storage, networking) via cloud providers.
- **Providers**: AWS (Amazon Web Services), GCP (Google Cloud Platform), OCI (Oracle Cloud Infrastructure).
- **Benefits**: Scalability, cost-efficiency, flexibility.

### 2. Core Cloud Services
- **Compute**:
  - **AWS**: EC2 (virtual servers), Lambda (serverless).
  - **GCP**: Compute Engine, Cloud Functions.
  - **OCI**: Compute Instances, Functions.
  - **Use Case**: Run applications or serverless workloads.
- **Storage**:
  - **AWS**: S3 (object storage), EBS (block storage).
  - **GCP**: Cloud Storage, Persistent Disk.
  - **OCI**: Object Storage, Block Volume.
  - **Use Case**: Store files, databases, or backups.
- **Networking**:
  - **AWS**: VPC (virtual private cloud), Route 53 (DNS).
  - **GCP**: VPC, Cloud DNS.
  - **OCI**: VCN (virtual cloud network), DNS.
  - **Use Case**: Secure network isolation, domain management.

### 3. Role in FAANG Interviews
- Technical questions test cloud knowledge (e.g., “Design a scalable file storage system”).
- Behavioral questions assess cloud project experience (e.g., “Tell me about a time you optimized a cloud system”).
- Align with company priorities (e.g., Amazon’s AWS expertise, Google’s scalability focus).

### 4. Relation to Previous Sections
- **Algorithms** (Section 1): Cloud aligns with efficient algorithms.
- **OOD** (Section 2): Cloud supports object-oriented system design.
- **Design Patterns** (Section 3): Patterns apply to cloud architectures.
- **Design Principles** (Section 4): SOLID guides cloud design.
- **HLD/LLD** (Sections 5–6): Cloud is central to system design (e.g., Mock LLD Interview, Lecture 31).
- **Behavioral Skills** (Section 7): Articulating cloud solutions builds on communication (Lecture 2).
- **Clean Code** (Section 9): Clear code supports cloud implementations.

## Code Example: Interacting with AWS S3 in Java
Below is a Java example demonstrating how to upload a file to AWS S3 using the AWS SDK, simulating a file storage system.

```java
import com.amazonaws.auth.AWSStaticCredentialsProvider;
import com.amazonaws.auth.BasicAWSCredentials;
import com.amazonaws.services.s3.AmazonS3;
import com.amazonaws.services.s3.AmazonS3ClientBuilder;
import com.amazonaws.services.s3.model.PutObjectRequest;
import java.io.File;

public class S3FileUploader {
    private final AmazonS3 s3Client;
    private final String bucketName;

    public S3FileUploader(String accessKey, String secretKey, String region, String bucketName) {
        BasicAWSCredentials credentials = new BasicAWSCredentials(accessKey, secretKey);
        this.s3Client = AmazonS3ClientBuilder
            .standard()
            .withCredentials(new AWSStaticCredentialsProvider(credentials))
            .withRegion(region)
            .build();
        this.bucketName = bucketName;
    }

    public void uploadFile(String fileKey, String filePath) throws Exception {
        try {
            File file = new File(filePath);
            if (!file.exists()) {
                throw new Exception("File not found: " + filePath);
            }
            PutObjectRequest request = new PutObjectRequest(bucketName, fileKey, file);
            s3Client.putObject(request);
            System.out.println("File uploaded to S3: " + fileKey);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            throw new Exception("Failed to upload file: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String accessKey = "your-access-key"; // Replace with your AWS access key
        String secretKey = "your-secret-key"; // Replace with your AWS secret key
        String region = "us-east-1";
        String bucketName = "your-bucket-name";
        String fileKey = "example.txt";
        String filePath = "path/to/example.txt";

        S3FileUploader uploader = new S3FileUploader(accessKey, secretKey, region, bucketName);
        try {
            uploader.uploadFile(fileKey, filePath);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.err.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

- **Explanation**:
  - Uses AWS SDK for Java to interact with S3.
  - Configures credentials and region for AWS access.
  - Uploads a file to an S3 bucket, handling errors.
- **Setup**:
  - Add AWS SDK dependency to your project (e.g., Maven: `com.amazonaws:aws-java-sdk-s3`).
  - Replace `accessKey`, `secretKey`, `bucketName`, and `filePath` with valid values.
- **Big O**: O(1) for API call initiation; actual upload time depends on file size and network.
- **Edge Cases**: Handles missing files, invalid credentials, or network issues.
- **Trade-Offs**: S3 for scalability vs. local storage for simplicity.

## FAANG-Specific Tips
- **Amazon (AWS Expertise)**:
  - Highlight AWS services (e.g., “I used S3 for scalable storage”).

    - **Task**: “I was responsible for implementation.”
    - **Action**: “I deployed S3 with caching, prioritizing speed.”
    - **Result**: “We reduced access time by 40%.”
- **Netflix (Freedom & Responsibility)**:
  - Emphasize autonomous cloud decisions (e.g., “I independently chose OCI Object Storage”).
  - Focus on high-impact outcomes (e.g., “Improved scalability for streaming”).
  - STAR Response:
    - **Situation**: “Our system needed scalable storage.”
    - **Task**: “I was responsible for the solution.”
    - **Action**: “I independently chose OCI Object Storage and implemented it.”
    - **Result**: “We scaled to 100,000 users, cutting costs by 15%.”

## Practice Exercise
**Problem**: Design a simple file storage system using a cloud service (AWS S3, GCP Cloud Storage, or OCI Object Storage).
1. **Define Requirements**:
   - Store and retrieve files scalably.
   - Ensure cost-efficiency and reliability.
2. **Craft a STAR Response**:
   - **Situation**: Describe a project needing cloud storage.
   - **Task**: Clarify your role (e.g., designer, implementer).
   - **Action**: List 2–3 actions (e.g., chose S3, configured access).
   - **Result**: Quantify outcomes (e.g., reduced costs, scaled users).
3. **Tailor to a FAANG Company**:
   - Align with Amazon (AWS), Google (GCP), Meta (speed), or Netflix (autonomy).
4. **Write and Review**:
   - Write a 100–150 word STAR response.
   - Ensure clarity, specificity, and alignment with cloud concepts.

**Sample Response (Amazon - Ownership)**:
- **Situation**: “Our application needed scalable file storage for user data.”
- **Task**: “As lead, I was responsible for designing the solution.”
- **Action**: “I chose AWS S3, configured lifecycle policies for cost optimization, and ensured secure access.”
- **Result**: “We reduced storage costs by 20% and scaled to 100,000 users.”
