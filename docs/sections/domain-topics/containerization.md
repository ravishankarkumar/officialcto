# Containerization: Docker and Kubernetes

## Overview
Welcome to the third lecture of **Section 8: Domain-Specific Topics (Cloud, Infra, and Beyond)** in the *Official CTO* journey! **Containerization** with Docker and **orchestration** with Kubernetes are foundational for modern cloud-native systems, enabling scalable, portable deployments. In this 20-minute lesson, we explore **Docker and Kubernetes**, focusing on their application in distributed systems. With a practical example of containerizing a Java application and deploying it with Kubernetes, we’ll prepare you for FAANG interviews and real-world projects. Drawing from my 8+ years of mentoring engineers, this lecture equips you to master containerization. Let’s continue your *Official CTO* journey to become a well-rounded engineer!

Inspired by *Designing Data-Intensive Applications* and Docker/Kubernetes documentation, this lesson provides actionable insights, code examples, and strategies for orchestration.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand **containerization** with Docker and **orchestration** with Kubernetes.
- Learn to **containerize applications** and **deploy with Kubernetes** for distributed systems.
- Prepare for **FAANG interviews** with containerization-focused questions.
- Implement a **Dockerfile** and **Kubernetes YAML** for a Java application.

## Why Containerization Matters
Docker and Kubernetes are critical for FAANG roles, enabling scalable, resilient systems. Drawing from my experience mentoring engineers, I’ve seen containerization expertise set candidates apart in interviews and leadership roles. This lecture ensures you can articulate Docker and Kubernetes concepts, design scalable deployments, and align with industry trends.

In software engineering, containerization helps you:
- **Ace Interviews**: Answer container-related technical questions.
- **Build Scalable Systems**: Deploy portable, consistent applications.
- **Ensure Resilience**: Orchestrate fault-tolerant systems with Kubernetes.
- **Drive Efficiency**: Automate deployments and scaling.

## Key Concepts
### 1. Containerization with Docker
- **Definition**: Packaging applications and dependencies into portable containers.
- **Key Features**: Dockerfiles, images, containers, Docker Hub.
- **Benefits**: Consistency, portability, isolation.
- **Use Case**: Containerize a Java microservice for deployment.

### 2. Orchestration with Kubernetes
- **Definition**: Managing containerized applications across clusters for scalability and resilience.
- **Key Features**: Pods, deployments, services, auto-scaling.
- **Benefits**: Fault tolerance, load balancing, automated scaling.
- **Use Case**: Deploy a containerized app across multiple nodes.

### 3. Role in Distributed Systems
- **Docker**: Ensures consistent environments for microservices.
- **Kubernetes**: Orchestrates microservices for scalability and reliability.
- **Example**: Deploy a distributed system with multiple microservices.

### 4. Role in FAANG Interviews
- Technical questions test containerization knowledge (e.g., “Design a scalable microservice with Kubernetes”).
- Behavioral questions assess containerization experience (e.g., “Tell me about a time you optimized a deployment”).
- Align with company priorities (e.g., Amazon’s AWS EKS, Google’s GKE).

### 5. Relation to Previous Sections
- **Algorithms** (Section 1): Containerization aligns with efficient resource allocation.
- **OOD** (Section 2): Docker supports modular system design.
- **Design Patterns** (Section 3): Kubernetes reflects pattern-driven orchestration.
- **Design Principles** (Section 4): SOLID guides containerized architectures.
- **HLD/LLD** (Sections 5–6): Containerization is central to system design (e.g., Mock LLD Interview, Lecture 31).
- **Behavioral Skills** (Section 7): Articulating solutions builds on communication (Lecture 2).
- **Cloud Fundamentals** (Section 8, Lecture 1): Builds on AWS/GCP/OCI services.
- **IaC with Terraform** (Section 8, Lecture 2): Complements infrastructure provisioning.
- **Clean Code** (Section 9): Clear code supports containerized apps.

## Code Example: Containerizing a Java App with Docker and Kubernetes
Below is a practical example of containerizing a Java application using a **Dockerfile** and deploying it with **Kubernetes YAML**.

### Dockerfile
```dockerfile
# Use official Java 17 base image
FROM openjdk:17-jdk-slim

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the Java application JAR (built separately)
COPY target/my-app-1.0.jar /app/my-app.jar

# Expose port 8080
EXPOSE 8080

# Run the Java application
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "/app/my-app.jar"]
```

### Kubernetes Deployment YAML
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app-deployment
  labels:
    app: my-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-app
        image: my-app:1.0
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
        resources:
          limits:
            cpu: "0.5"
            memory: "512Mi"
          requests:
            cpu: "0.2"
            memory: "256Mi"
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-app-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
  type: LoadBalancer
```

- **Explanation**:
  - **Dockerfile**:
    - Uses `openjdk:17-jdk-slim` as the base image for a Java app.
    - Copies a pre-built JAR (`my-app-1.0.jar`) to the container.
    - Exposes port 8080 and runs the Java app.
  - **Kubernetes YAML**:
    - Defines a deployment with 3 replicas for scalability.
    - Configures a pod with the `my-app:1.0` image, resource limits, and port 8080.
    - Creates a LoadBalancer service to expose the app externally.
- **Setup**:
  - Build the Java app (`mvn package` to create `my-app-1.0.jar`).
  - Build the Docker image: `docker build -t my-app:1.0 .`.
  - Push to a registry (e.g., Docker Hub): `docker push my-app:1.0`.
  - Deploy with Kubernetes: `kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml`.
- **Big O**: O(1) for Docker build and Kubernetes apply; runtime depends on app and cluster.
- **Edge Cases**: Handles missing JAR, invalid images, or Kubernetes resource limits.
- **Trade-Offs**: Docker for portability vs. VM for isolation; Kubernetes for orchestration vs. manual scaling.

### FAANG-Specific Tips

    - **Task**: “I was responsible for containerization.”
    - **Action**: “I used Docker and Kubernetes to deploy quickly, prioritizing speed.”
    - **Result**: “We launched in one week, reducing latency by 40%.”
- **Netflix (Freedom & Responsibility)**:
  - Emphasize autonomous decisions (e.g., “I independently designed a Kubernetes deployment”).
  - Focus on high-impact outcomes (e.g., “Improved scalability for streaming”).
  - STAR Response:
    - **Situation**: “Our system needed scalable deployment.”
    - **Task**: “I was responsible for orchestration.”
    - **Action**: “I independently containerized a Java app with Docker and deployed it on Kubernetes.”
    - **Result**: “We scaled to 100,000 users, cutting costs by 15%.”

## Practice Exercise
**Problem**: Containerize a simple Java application and deploy it with Kubernetes.
1. **Define Requirements**:
   - Create a Java app (e.g., a REST API).
   - Containerize with Docker and deploy with Kubernetes.
   - Ensure scalability and reliability.
2. **Craft a STAR Response**:
   - **Situation**: Describe a project needing containerization (e.g., a microservice).
   - **Task**: Clarify your role (e.g., container designer).
   - **Action**: List 2–3 actions (e.g., wrote Dockerfile, deployed with Kubernetes).
   - **Result**: Quantify outcomes (e.g., scaled system, reduced latency).
3. **Write Docker and Kubernetes Config**:
   - Create a `Dockerfile` and Kubernetes `deployment.yaml`.
   - Test locally with `docker build` and `kubectl apply`.
4. **Tailor to a FAANG Company**:
   - Align with Amazon (EKS), Google (GKE), Meta (speed), or Netflix (autonomy).
5. **Write and Review**:
   - Write a 100–150 word STAR response.
   - Ensure clarity, specificity, and alignment with containerization concepts.

**Sample Response (Google - GKE)**:
- **Situation**: “Our application needed scalable, resilient deployment.”
- **Task**: “As lead, I was responsible for containerization.”
- **Action**: “I wrote a Dockerfile for a Java app and deployed it on GKE, collaborating on scaling configs.”
- **Result**: “We achieved 99.9% uptime, supporting 1M users.”

## Conclusion
Mastering containerization with Docker and Kubernetes equips you to excel in FAANG interviews and build scalable systems. This lecture builds on cloud fundamentals and IaC from Lectures 1–2, advancing your *Official CTO* journey.
