# IaC with Terraform

## Overview
Welcome to the second lecture of **Section 8: Domain-Specific Topics (Cloud, Infra, and Beyond)** in the *Official CTO* journey! **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** with Terraform is a cornerstone of modern cloud engineering, enabling automated, scalable infrastructure management. In this 20-minute lesson, we explore **Terraform for provisioning distributed systems**, covering its core features and application in cloud environments like AWS. With a practical HCL example for setting up an AWS-based distributed system, we’ll prepare you for FAANG interviews and real-world projects. Drawing from my 8+ years of mentoring engineers, this lecture equips you to master IaC. Let’s continue your *Official CTO* journey to become a well-rounded engineer!

Inspired by *Designing Data-Intensive Applications* and Terraform documentation, this lesson provides actionable insights, a code example, and strategies for cloud expertise.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** and **Terraform** fundamentals.
- Learn to **provision cloud infrastructure** for distributed systems using Terraform.
- Prepare for **FAANG interviews** with IaC-focused questions.
- Implement an **HCL-based Terraform configuration** for AWS.

## Why IaC with Terraform Matters
Terraform enables consistent, repeatable infrastructure management, critical for FAANG roles requiring scalable, automated systems. Drawing from my experience mentoring engineers, I’ve seen IaC expertise set candidates apart in interviews and leadership roles. This lecture ensures you can articulate Terraform’s benefits, design infrastructure, and align with industry trends.

In software engineering, IaC with Terraform helps you:
- **Ace Interviews**: Answer IaC-related technical questions.
- **Automate Infrastructure**: Provision resources efficiently.
- **Ensure Scalability**: Design robust, distributed systems.
- **Drive Consistency**: Maintain reproducible environments.

## Key Concepts
### 1. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- **Definition**: Managing infrastructure through code, enabling automation and version control.
- **Benefits**: Consistency, scalability, reduced manual errors.
- **Tools**: Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, Pulumi.

### 2. Terraform Core Features
- **HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language)**: Declarative syntax for defining resources.
- **Providers**: Plugins for cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, GCP, OCI).
- **State Management**: Tracks infrastructure state (e.g., `terraform.tfstate`).
- **Modules**: Reusable configurations for modularity.
- **Workflow**: Plan (`terraform plan`), apply (`terraform apply`), destroy (`terraform destroy`).

### 3. Terraform in Distributed Systems
- **Use Case**: Provision compute, storage, and networking for distributed applications.
- **Components**: EC2 instances, VPCs, load balancers, S3 buckets.
- **Benefits**: Scalability, fault tolerance, automated deployments.

### 4. Role in FAANG Interviews
- Technical questions test IaC knowledge (e.g., “Design a scalable system with Terraform”).
- Behavioral questions assess IaC experience (e.g., “Tell me about a time you automated infrastructure”).
- Align with company priorities (e.g., Amazon’s AWS expertise, Google’s scalability focus).

### 5. Relation to Previous Sections
- **Algorithms** (Section 1): IaC aligns with efficient resource allocation.
- **OOD** (Section 2): Terraform supports modular system design.
- **Design Patterns** (Section 3): Modules reflect pattern-driven architecture.
- **Design Principles** (Section 4): IaC mirrors SOLID’s modularity.
- **HLD/LLD** (Sections 5–6): IaC is central to system design (e.g., Mock LLD Interview, Lecture 31).
- **Behavioral Skills** (Section 7): Articulating IaC solutions builds on communication (Lecture 2).
- **Cloud Fundamentals** (Section 8, Lecture 1): Builds on AWS/GCP/OCI services.
- **Clean Code** (Section 9): Clear HCL code supports maintainable infrastructure.

## Code Example: Provisioning an AWS-Based Distributed System with Terraform
Below is an HCL configuration to provision an AWS VPC, EC2 instance, and S3 bucket for a distributed system.

```hcl
# Configure the AWS provider
provider "aws" {
  region     = "us-east-1"
  access_key = var.aws_access_key
  secret_key = var.aws_secret_key
}

# Variables for sensitive data
variable "aws_access_key" {
  description = "AWS access key"
  type        = string
  sensitive   = true
}

variable "aws_secret_key" {
  description = "AWS secret key"
  type        = string
  sensitive   = true
}

# Create a VPC
resource "aws_vpc" "main_vpc" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
  tags = {
    Name = "main-vpc"
  }
}

# Create a subnet
resource "aws_subnet" "main_subnet" {
  vpc_id     = aws_vpc.main_vpc.id
  cidr_block = "10.0.1.0/24"
  tags = {
    Name = "main-subnet"
  }
}

# Create an EC2 instance
resource "aws_instance" "app_server" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0" # Amazon Linux 2 AMI (update as needed)
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  subnet_id     = aws_subnet.main_subnet.id
  tags = {
    Name = "app-server"
  }
}

# Create an S3 bucket
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "data_bucket" {
  bucket = "my-distributed-system-bucket"
  acl    = "private"
  tags = {
    Name = "data-bucket"
  }
}

# Output the EC2 instance public IP
output "instance_ip" {
  description = "Public IP of the EC2 instance"
  value       = aws_instance.app_server.public_ip
}

# Output the S3 bucket name
output "bucket_name" {
  description = "Name of the S3 bucket"
  value       = aws_s3_bucket.data_bucket.bucket
}
```

- **Explanation**:
  - Defines an AWS provider with credentials (stored securely in variables).
  - Provisions a VPC, subnet, EC2 instance, and S3 bucket for a distributed system.
  - Outputs the EC2 instance IP and S3 bucket name for verification.
- **Setup**:
  - Install Terraform (`terraform init`).
  - Store AWS credentials in a `terraform.tfvars` file (e.g., `aws_access_key = "your-key"`).
  - Run `terraform plan` to preview and `terraform apply` to provision.
- **Big O**: O(1) for Terraform’s planning; actual provisioning time depends on AWS API latency.
- **Edge Cases**: Handles missing credentials, invalid AMIs, or bucket name conflicts.
- **Trade-Offs**: EC2 for flexibility vs. Lambda for serverless; S3 for scalability vs. EBS for performance.

1. **Define Requirements**:
   - Create a VPC, one compute instance, and a storage bucket.
   - Ensure scalability and cost-efficiency.
2. **Craft a STAR Response**:
   - **Situation**: Describe a project needing infrastructure (e.g., distributed app).
   - **Task**: Clarify your role (e.g., infrastructure designer).
   - **Action**: List 2–3 actions (e.g., wrote Terraform config, deployed resources).
   - **Result**: Quantify outcomes (e.g., scaled system, reduced costs).
3. **Write Terraform Config**:
   - Create a basic HCL file for AWS, GCP, or OCI.
   - Run `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` to test locally.
4. **Tailor to a FAANG Company**:
   - Align with Amazon (AWS), Google (GCP), Meta (speed), or Netflix (autonomy).
5. **Write and Review**:
   - Write a 100–150 word STAR response.
   - Ensure clarity, specificity, and alignment with Terraform concepts.

**Sample Response (Amazon - Ownership)**:
- **Situation**: “Our application needed scalable infrastructure for user data.”
- **Task**: “As lead, I was responsible for provisioning resources.”
- **Action**: “I used Terraform to define a VPC, EC2 instance, and S3 bucket, optimizing with lifecycle policies.”
- **Result**: “We scaled to 100,000 users, reducing costs by 20%.”
