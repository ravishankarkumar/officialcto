# Monitoring and Alerts

## Overview
Welcome to the fifth lecture of **Section 8: Domain-Specific Topics (Cloud, Infra, and Beyond)** in the *Official CTO* journey! **Monitoring and alerts** are critical for ensuring the reliability and performance of distributed systems at FAANG companies. In this 20-minute lesson, we explore **Elasticsearch and AWS Lambda** for monitoring, focusing on their application in distributed systems. With a Java-based example of logging metrics to Elasticsearch via AWS Lambda, we’ll prepare you for FAANG interviews and real-world projects. Drawing from my 8+ years of mentoring engineers, this lecture equips you to master monitoring and alerting. Let’s continue your *Official CTO* journey to become a well-rounded engineer!

Inspired by *Designing Data-Intensive Applications* and Elasticsearch/AWS documentation, this lesson provides actionable insights, a code example, and strategies for system reliability.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand **monitoring and alerting** with Elasticsearch and AWS Lambda.
- Learn to **implement monitoring** for distributed systems.
- Prepare for **FAANG interviews** with monitoring-focused questions.
- Implement a **Java-based monitoring solution** using Elasticsearch and Lambda.

## Why Monitoring and Alerts Matter
Monitoring and alerting ensure system health, enabling rapid detection and resolution of issues in distributed systems. Drawing from my experience mentoring engineers, I’ve seen expertise in these areas set candidates apart in FAANG interviews and leadership roles. This lecture ensures you can design monitoring solutions, articulate their benefits, and align with industry trends.

In software engineering, monitoring and alerts help you:
- **Ace Interviews**: Answer monitoring-related technical questions.
- **Ensure Reliability**: Detect and resolve system issues.
- **Optimize Performance**: Monitor key metrics like latency and uptime.
- **Drive Proactive Management**: Set up alerts for critical failures.

## Key Concepts
### 1. Monitoring in Distributed Systems
- **Definition**: Collecting and analyzing metrics to track system health (e.g., CPU usage, latency).
- **Key Components**: Metrics collection, storage, visualization, alerting.
- **Tools**: Elasticsearch (log storage), Prometheus, Grafana.

### 2. Alerts
- **Definition**: Notifications triggered by predefined conditions (e.g., high error rates).
- **Key Features**: Thresholds, notifications (e.g., email, Slack), escalation.
- **Tools**: AWS CloudWatch, PagerDuty, Elasticsearch Watcher.

### 3. Elasticsearch and AWS Lambda
- **Elasticsearch**: Distributed search and analytics engine for storing and querying logs.
- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless compute for processing events (e.g., logging metrics).
- **Use Case**: Log application metrics to Elasticsearch via Lambda for real-time monitoring.

### 4. Role in FAANG Interviews
- Technical questions test monitoring knowledge (e.g., “Design a monitoring system for a distributed app”).
- Behavioral questions assess experience (e.g., “Tell me about a time you resolved a system issue using monitoring”).
- Align with company priorities (e.g., Amazon’s AWS CloudWatch, Google’s observability focus).

### 5. Relation to Previous Sections
- **Algorithms** (Section 1): Monitoring aligns with efficient data processing.
- **OOD** (Section 2): Monitoring supports system design observability.
- **Design Patterns** (Section 3): Observer pattern applies to alerts.
- **Design Principles** (Section 4): SOLID guides monitoring design.
- **HLD/LLD** (Sections 5–6): Monitoring is central to system design (e.g., Mock LLD Interview, Lecture 31).
- **Behavioral Skills** (Section 7): Articulating solutions builds on communication (Lecture 2).
- **Cloud Fundamentals** (Section 8, Lecture 1): Builds on AWS services like Lambda.
- **IaC with Terraform** (Section 8, Lecture 2): Complements infrastructure provisioning.
- **Containerization** (Section 8, Lecture 3): Monitoring supports Kubernetes deployments.
- **Distributed Systems** (Section 8, Lecture 4): Monitoring ensures CAP compliance.
- **Clean Code** (Section 9): Clear code supports maintainable monitoring.

## Code Example: Logging Metrics to Elasticsearch via AWS Lambda in Java
Below is a Java example demonstrating how to log metrics to Elasticsearch from an AWS Lambda function.

```java
import com.amazonaws.services.lambda.runtime.Context;
import com.amazonaws.services.lambda.runtime.RequestHandler;
import org.apache.http.HttpHost;
import org.elasticsearch.client.RestClient;
import org.elasticsearch.client.RestHighLevelClient;
import org.elasticsearch.action.index.IndexRequest;
import org.elasticsearch.common.xcontent.XContentType;

import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class LambdaElasticsearchLogger implements RequestHandler<Map<String, String>, String> {
    private final RestHighLevelClient esClient;

    public LambdaElasticsearchLogger() {
        this.esClient = new RestHighLevelClient(
            RestClient.builder(new HttpHost("your-elasticsearch-endpoint", 9200, "http"))
        );
    }

    @Override
    public String handleRequest(Map<String, String> input, Context context) {
        try {
            // Sample metrics: latency and error count
            Map<String, Object> metrics = new HashMap<>();
            metrics.put("timestamp", System.currentTimeMillis());
            metrics.put("service", input.getOrDefault("service", "my-app"));
            metrics.put("latency_ms", Double.parseDouble(input.getOrDefault("latency", "100.0")));
            metrics.put("error_count", Integer.parseInt(input.getOrDefault("errors", "0")));

            // Index metrics in Elasticsearch
            IndexRequest indexRequest = new IndexRequest("app-metrics")
                .source(metrics, XContentType.JSON);
            esClient.index(indexRequest, RequestOptions.DEFAULT);

            return "Logged metrics to Elasticsearch: " + metrics;
        } catch (Exception e) {
            return "Error logging metrics: " + e.getMessage();
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LambdaElasticsearchLogger logger = new LambdaElasticsearchLogger();
        Map<String, String> input = new HashMap<>();
        input.put("service", "my-app");
        input.put("latency", "150.5");
        input.put("errors", "2");
        System.out.println(logger.handleRequest(input, null));
    }
}
```

- **Explanation**:
  - Implements an AWS Lambda function using the AWS SDK for Java.
  - Connects to Elasticsearch via the `RestHighLevelClient`.
  - Logs metrics (e.g., latency, error count) to an `app-metrics` index.
  - Handles errors for robustness.
- **Setup**:
  - Add dependencies: `com.amazonaws:aws-lambda-java-core`, `org.elasticsearch.client:elasticsearch-rest-high-level-client`.
  - Deploy as an AWS Lambda function with Elasticsearch endpoint configured.
  - Replace `your-elasticsearch-endpoint` with your Elasticsearch host.
- **Big O**: O(1) for indexing a single document; network latency varies.
- **Edge Cases**: Handles missing input, invalid metrics, or Elasticsearch connection failures.
- **Trade-Offs**: Elasticsearch for scalable logging vs. CloudWatch for simplicity; Lambda for serverless vs. EC2 for control.

## Practice Exercise
**Problem**: Design a monitoring system for a distributed application using Elasticsearch and AWS Lambda.
1. **Define Requirements**:
   - Monitor latency and error rates.
   - Set up alerts for high errors or latency.
2. **Craft a STAR Response**:
   - **Situation**: Describe a project needing monitoring (e.g., distributed app).
   - **Task**: Clarify your role (e.g., monitoring designer).
   - **Action**: List 2–3 actions (e.g., configured Elasticsearch, set up Lambda).
   - **Result**: Quantify outcomes (e.g., reduced downtime, improved metrics).
3. **Write a Simple Implementation**:
   - Create a Java Lambda function to log metrics to Elasticsearch.
   - Test locally or deploy to AWS.
4. **Tailor to a FAANG Company**:
   - Align with Amazon (CloudWatch), Google (Stackdriver), Meta (speed), or Netflix (autonomy).
5. **Write and Review**:
   - Write a 100–150 word STAR response.
   - Ensure clarity, specificity, and alignment with monitoring concepts.

**Sample Response (Amazon - Dive Deep)**:
- **Situation**: “Our distributed app experienced intermittent failures.”
- **Task**: “As lead, I was responsible for monitoring.”
- **Action**: “I dove deep into metrics, implemented Lambda to log to CloudWatch, and set up alerts for errors.”
- **Result**: “We detected issues in under 5 minutes, ensuring 99.9% uptime.”
